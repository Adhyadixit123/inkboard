But the reality of modern air travel tells a very different story. Delays stretch into hours. Flights get canceled without warning. Passengers are bumped from seats they paid for, left stranded in terminals with nothing but a voucher and a vague apology. What most travelers don't realize is that they are often legally entitled to significant financial compensation — and the airlines are counting on them never finding out.\n\nThat's exactly the gap Indemsy was built to close.\n\nSince our founding, we have helped thousands of air passengers claim the money they were owed — money that airlines would have quietly kept if no one had pushed back. To date, our clients have recovered over a million dollars in compensation, and that number grows every single day. Not because we got lucky. Because we know the rules, we know the process, and we know how to fight on behalf of the people who fly.\n\nThe laws protecting air passengers are surprisingly strong. Regulations across the United States, European Union, and many other jurisdictions require airlines to compensate passengers for significant delays, cancellations, and denied boarding caused by circumstances within the airline's control. Depending on the route and the length of the delay, a single passenger can be entitled to hundreds of dollars in compensation. The problem is that airlines make the claims process complicated on purpose. They use legal language designed to confuse, create barriers that discourage follow-through, and often deny valid claims outright, betting that most passengers will simply give up.\n\nMost do. But Indemsy clients don't.\n\nOur team handles everything from start to finish. You tell us what happened — your flight number, your route, the date of your disruption — and we take it from there. We evaluate your claim, determine what you're owed under applicable law, and file on your behalf. If the airline pushes back, we push harder. We've seen nearly every tactic airlines use to delay or deny legitimate claims, and we know exactly how to respond. Our clients don't need to understand aviation law or spend weeks writing back-and-forth emails with airline customer service departments. That's our job.\n\nWhat makes Indemsy different from simply filing a complaint yourself isn't just experience — it's leverage. Airlines know that individual passengers are unlikely to escalate a dispute to the point where it costs the airline more to fight than to settle. When Indemsy is involved, that calculation changes entirely. We are persistent, we are thorough, and we don't back down. The airlines know it. That's why our clients see results that they never would have achieved on their own.\n\nWe work on a no-win, no-fee basis. If we don't recover compensation for you, you don't pay us anything. This isn't a gamble for our clients — it's a promise that we only take on cases we believe in, and that our incentives are perfectly aligned with yours. We win when you win. It's that simple.\n\nThe passengers we help aren't frequent flyers gaming a system. They're families who missed a wedding because their connecting flight was canceled. Business travelers who lost a critical day of work sitting in an airport gate. Solo travelers who were told their seat was overbooked and there was nothing the airline could do. There was always something that could be done. Indemsy is that something.\n\nAir travel is not going to get less complicated. Airlines are not going to start making it easy to claim the compensation you're owed. But with the right advocate in your corner, the frustration of a disrupted flight doesn't have to be the end of the story. For over a million dollars in recovered compensation and counting, it was just the beginning.","cover_image_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1772085020/Gemini_Generated_Image_4kbbvi4kbbvi4kbb_kiqgnn.png","cover_aspect_ratio":"4:3","status":"PUBLISHED","read_time_minutes":4,"engagement_score":0,"like_count":0,"comment_count":0,"share_count":0,"is_trending":false,"is_liked":false,"tags":[{"id":"news","name":"news","post_count":1},{"id":"travel","name":"travel","post_count":1}],"created_at":"2026-02-26T06:17:06.770Z","published_at":"2026-02-26T06:17:06.770Z"},{"id":"devto-3285421","title":"How OpenAI and Persona Built an Identity Surveillance Machine for the US Government","content":"","subtitle":"How OpenAI and Persona Built an Identity Surveillance Machine for the US Government   I was...","cover_image_url":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555066931-4365d14bab8c?w=600&q=80","cover_aspect_ratio":"16:9","author_id":"source-devto","author":{"id":"source-rain","email":"source-rain@inkboard.eu","username":"source-rain","display_name":"rain","avatar_url":"https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/initials/svg?seed=rain","role":"USER","is_verified":true,"is_suspended":false,"created_at":"2026-02-26T05:17:12.408Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"total_likes":0,"post_count":0},"tags":[{"id":"security","name":"security","post_count":1},{"id":"privacy","name":"privacy","post_count":1},{"id":"opensource","name":"opensource","post_count":1},{"id":"webdev","name":"webdev","post_count":1}],"source_url":"https://dev.to/rainkode/how-openai-and-persona-built-an-identity-surveillance-machine-for-the-us-government-1157","published_at":"2026-02-25T18:06:54Z","created_at":"2026-02-25T18:06:54Z","read_time_minutes":7,"source":"devto","status":"PUBLISHED","engagement_score":100,"like_count":321,"comment_count":47,"share_count":0,"is_trending":false},{"id":"devto-3285431","title":"Idempotent Pipelines: Build Once, Run Safely Forever","content":"","subtitle":"A pipeline runs, processes 100,000 records, and loads them into the target table.

Her scientific experience is mainly focused around her work as a wellness influencer, and a leader within the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) space – which has become the key pillar of the Trump administration’s health policy under Robert F Kennedy Jr.</p> <p>Means declined to give a simple yes-or-no answer when the committee chair, Republican senator Bill Cassidy, pressed her on whether, as surgeon general, she would encourage parents to vaccinate their children with routine shots such as the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p> <p>“I’m supportive of vaccination. I do believe that each patient, mother, parent, needs to have a conversation with their pediatrician about any medication they’re putting in their body and their children’s bodies,” Means said.</p> <p>When Cassidy asked whether she would state her position more clearly if confirmed, she replied: “I’m not an individual’s doctor, and every individual needs to talk to their doctor before putting a medication in their body.”</p> <p>Means’s comments come as measles outbreaks continue across the country, with South Carolina experiencing the worst measles outbreak in more than 30 years amid declining childhood immunization rates. In response, Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), urged Americans to “take the vaccine, please”<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/08/dr-mehmet-oz-measles-vaccine\"> earlier this month</a>. In an interview with CNN, Oz issued a rare plea from the Trump administration to insist upon inoculation. “Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people are equally susceptible to those illnesses,” he said. “But measles is one you should get your vaccine.”</p> <p>While Means insisted that anti-vaccine rhetoric “has never been a part” of her message and said she was “not here to complicate the issue on vaccines”, she repeatedly sidestepped direct questions from lawmakers about whether vaccines cause autism – a theory long discredited by the scientific community and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-autism\">promoted </a>by health secretary Kennedy.</p> <p>“The reality is that we have an autism crisis that’s increasing, and this is devastating to many families, and we do not know as a medical community what causes autism,” she said, while acknowledging that there is an overwhelming body of evidence refuting claims that vaccines cause the condition. “I also think that science is never settled, and I think that the effort to look at comprehensive, cumulative exposures into what is causing autism is important.”</p> <p>Means has spurned the medical establishment, noting that she dropped out of her residency because she grew “disillusioned with traditional healthcare”, which, she claims, focuses on diagnoses and prescriptions instead of diet and lifestyle.</p> <p>During her opening remarks before lawmakers, she praised Trump and Kennedy for inviting “a mature, candid, grand conversation about how our medical education and fixing perverse incentives can pull us back from the brink”.</p> <p>In 2024, Means co-authored a book, Good Energy, with her older brother Calley, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/rfk-jr-aide-attacks-u-s-health-system-as-corrupt-while-running-company-that-promotes-alternatives\">an entrepreneur</a> who currently serves as one of Kennedy’s close advisers and has also railed against the US medical establishment. The siblings argue in their book that metabolic health is the key to reversing chronic illness, a framing that critics say verges into pseudoscience. “Many doctors are doing the wrong things, pushing pills and interventions when an ultra-aggressive stance on diet and behavior would do far more for the patient in front of them,” Means writes in the book.</p> <p>The prospective surgeon general also co‑founded Levels, a health tracking company built around continuous glucose monitoring, as part of her belief that people need real‑time data to understand what’s driving their symptoms.</p> <p>In the past, Means has trodden lightly when it comes to the efficacy of vaccines, she is aligned with Kennedy’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations\">routine skepticism</a> of the number of vaccines children are recommended.</p> <p>“I also find it perplexing that people are often shamed for asking any questions about the 70+ injected medications going into their children’s bodies before the age of 18,” <a href=\"https://www.caseymeans.com/learn/newsletter-31?rq=vaccine\">she wrote on her website</a>. “I am not making a statement about the utility of vaccines; I am making a statement about an $80bn industry getting to have legal immunity from wrongdoing and having the American population in a chokehold that forces them to comply with the complete schedule or face consequences.”</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Trump administration announced it would slash routine vaccine recommendations during childhood from 17 to 11 jabs, a move that public health experts said would erode trust in inoculations and allow infectious diseases to spread.</p> <p>Means’s nomination has received <a href=\"https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/press/nurses-and-public-health-advocates-join-to-strongly-oppose-new-us-surgeon-general-nomination\">significant backlash</a> from the US scientific community. Former surgeon general Richard Carmona, who served under George W Bush, told the Guardian that Means’s nomination was a “disgrace” to the future of America’s public health system. “She has no significant public health background experience. She has no scalable leadership experience,” he said.</p> <p>Under Kennedy’s leadership, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been beset with chaos. Grants have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/19/trump-science-funding-cuts\">terminated</a>, there has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-leaders-quit-susan-monarez-firing\">a mass exodus of officials</a> from key agencies, and anti-vaccine loyalists have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/25/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk-acip\">installed </a>to the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP). Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who ultimately cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as Trump’s health secretary last year, did so despite expressing concern about Kennedy’s anti‑vaccine record. Kennedy assured him during the confirmation process that he would not interfere with the make-up of the ACIP.

Don’t give up on the truth.”</p> <p>Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said the president had missed his moment. “President Trump had the chance to bring the country together tonight. Instead, we got a campaign rally where he lied, ducked responsibility and had zero answers for Americans worried about the challenges they’re facing.”</p> <p>Trump’s tariff agenda featured prominently in the address, in which he framed it as the foundation of an industrial revival. But Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona doubted that his constituents had heard anything of use. “One year into his presidency, families are paying more at the grocery store. Seniors are struggling to afford their prescription drugs. Small business owners are having trouble keeping their doors open, and President Trump’s illegal tariffs are making it worse.”</p> <p>Representative Raul Ruiz of California went through the speech’s claims one by one. “He lied to us about inflation, while his tariffs have increased costs for all of us. He lied to us about healthcare, while his policies took away health coverage from millions of Americans. He lied to us about protecting retirees, while he is doing everything he can to dismantle social security and Medicare.”</p> <p>Ruiz added: “Trump wants desperately a Nobel prize – with all his lies, he should try to get one for fiction.”</p> <p>Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia said: “Their proudest accomplishment is taking food away from working families to give their donors another tax cut.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/25/trump-state-of-the-union-factcheck\">Jobs, gas prices and ending wars: factchecking Trump’s State of the Union claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The mood in the chamber was similarly testy during the speech.

Trump had claimed gains on the border, falling crime, record military recruitment and a reviving economy, and his party took him at his word, and backed him up.</p> <p>Representative Byron Donalds of Florida posted on X immediately after the address: “In just ONE YEAR, we have achieved a transformation like NO OTHER. Economy BOOMING. Inflation UNDER CONTROL. Border SECURED. Military recruitment at RECORD LEVELS. Crime DOWN. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. The Golden Age of America is upon us.”</p> <p>Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma singled out the moment Trump challenged members of Congress to stand if they believed the government’s first duty was to protect American citizens rather than undocumented migrants. “The contrast was clear,” Mullin wrote. “President Trump is an America First fighter, and a fearless patriot.”</p> <p>Representative Tony Wied of Wisconsin pointed to the manufacturing theme running through the address. “It’s time that we re-industrialize our great country and really ignite our manufacturing base,” he said in an interview on C-Span. “That’s what the president is focused on, that’s what House Republicans are focused on. I think we’re moving in the right direction.”</p> <p>Representative Jason Smith called it “the strongest State of the Union Address I’ve attended”, saying Trump’s vision “fosters patriotism, defends American citizens, and will deliver another year of historic results”.</p> <p>Many Democrats highlighted the distance between that version of events and the daily lives for their constituents. Representative Luz Rivas of California, in a post in Spanish, said families in her district were “feeling the impact of high prices and the presence of ICE in our communities” and that she and her colleagues would “continue fighting to hold the Trump administration accountable for all the chaos they have caused in our country”.</p> <p>Representative Adelita Grijalva of Arizona summed up the evening up for her party: “That was two hours of rambling completely detached from reality.

Despite being owned by music company <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/umg-abkco-win-copyright-case-against-uk-filmmaker-over-docs-about-the-rolling-stones-other-artists/\">ABKCO</a>, Beckman told <a href=\"https://variety.com/2026/music/news/melania-documentary-producer-jonny-greenwood-music-interview-1236670805/\">Variety</a> that Jagger “was actually involved” and “gave us his blessing”.</p> <p>“We worked very close with them on that,” Beckman continued. “And that wasn’t a political thing. With the Stones, they were just like, ‘Oh, you’re making a nice movie.’ They were like able to get over the hurdle. It’s not politics – it’s just some story about some woman that is going from being a civilian back into the White House, and this movie looks cool and Brett [Ratner] is doing a cool job and Melania Trump is focused, and let’s do it. We showed it to them and they were impressed.”</p> <p>Speaking off the record, the source close to Jagger said he felt scepticism was necessary as the producer was attempting to promote the movie. A spokesperson for the Rolling Stones also told the Guardian the deal to use Gimme Shelter in the film was made exclusively between rights holders ABKCO and Melania’s producers, and that the band had nothing to do with it.</p> <p>The Rolling Stones are among those artists who have previously objected to the use of their songs in rallies for Donald Trump. Others include Guns N’ Roses. Grace Jones, the estate of Prince, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, Adele, Queen, REM, Elton John, Abba, Jack White, Céline Dion, the Foo Fighters and the estates of Isaac Hayes and Tom Petty.</p> <p>Beckman also told Variety that the first three of these had also been approached with a view to using their music on Melania, but refused on political grounds.</p> <p>He clarified that the members of Guns N’ Roses were split on the decision, which needed to be unanimous, while Jones “apparently couldn’t get over the political hurdle, notwithstanding the fact that the film is not a political film”. While the rights holders to the Prince song requested were reportedly in favour of it being used, the lawyer managing his estate vetoed the request, saying: “Prince would never want his song associated with Donald Trump.”</p> <p>Beckman said that he protested that the film was “not a Donald Trump film! He comes into the movie once in a while, but this is all about Melania. It’s not political. And that guy blocked it. It’s so ridiculous.”</p>    <p>The Village People anthem YMCA is a staple of Trump rallies and features on the Melania soundtrack, as does Billie Jean by Michael Jackson, which Melania says is her favourite song by her favourite artist.</p> <p>As well as Jackson’s version, the audience hears an impromptu cover by the first lady and Ratner as they duet on the tune in the back of a limo.</p> <p>In the Variety interview, Beckman – who has been an adviser to Melania Trump for 25 years<strong> –</strong> also discussed the impasse over use of a song from Jonny Greenwood’s soundtrack to Phantom Thread. Greenwood and director Paul Thomas Anderson requested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/feb/09/melania-movie-greenwood-anderson-phantom-thread\">the removal</a> of the track, citing a lack of notice given to Greenwood by rights owner Universal. The music currently remains in Ratner’s film and Beckman said he believed it would stay so “for ever, regardless of the infrastructure which delivers the content”.</p>    <p>Beckman attributed Greenwood’s distaste to “just part of the unfortunate time we’re living in. We went out and created a nice film that doesn’t get into any kind of political policy or anything like that.” He also said the row had not dinted his fandom for Radiohead, saying he would continued to “listen to their music every single day”.</p> <p>Amazon paid $40m (£29.6m) for the rights to Melania and spent $35m (£25.9m) on marketing. The film opened earlier this month and has so far made around $16.4m (£12.1m) worldwide, 98% of which comes from its US take.</p> <p>The film scored a better-than-expected $7m (£5.2m) in the US on its first weekend of release before falling 67% in its second week. In the UK it opened at No 29 before falling 88% week-on-week to No 62. No showtimes are currently available for the film in the UK.</p> <p>Beckman addressed the <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/melania\">record-breaking disparity</a> between the film’s critics rating on aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes and the scores given to the films by audience members (who could verify a ticket purchase via Fandango).</p> <p>“What really is a critic’s job today?” he said. “It’s worse than bias. It’s like they’re voting, with political ideology first. There were some critiques I read that didn’t even talk about the film; they only spoke about President Trump.

Today each year <a href=\"https://www.sightsavers.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sightsavers-annual-report-2024.pdf\">it funds more than 9m eye examinations</a> and half a million sight-saving operations in 30 countries.</p> <p>Aged 19, Jean McDermid, as she was then, met John Wilson in 1943 when he lodged in her family home in Eastcote, west London. The couple, who married in 1944, shared a radical vision to help the millions of people globally affected by blindness. </p> <p>In the 1940s John, who was blind himself, after an explosion in a school chemistry lesson when he was 12, worked for the National Institute for the Blind (now the RNIB). In 1946-47 he participated in a government tour of British colonial territories in Africa and the Middle East, and was appalled at the sheer number of people who were blind due to avoidable causes such as disease, malnutrition and lack of medicines. Determined to help, he quit his job and the couple set up their charity and started fundraising. </p> <p>Theirs was a tight-knit double-act and their skills dovetailed. They travelled tirelessly, with Wilson acting as her husband’s “eyes”. She was a talented photographer, fundraiser and communicator, persuading politicians including Lord Halifax, the former foreign secretary, and well-known blind people such as Helen Keller to support them. </p> <p>In 1950, one of their first trips was to the Gold Coast (now Ghana). They visited the Nakong area on the River Sisili, a hotspot for the parasitic disease onchocerciasis. Transmitted by tiny flies that breed near the river and bite humans, the parasites burrow into the body causing permanent sight loss. </p> <p>Nakong was known as “the country of the blind” and Wilson said: “It was awful, a place of horror.” Most villagers over the age of 12 were blind, so they had to feel their way along hemp ropes to reach the well or get their children to lead them. Thinking ahead about how to fundraise – the disease has been treatable since the 1980s with the drug ivermectin – Wilson knew the name was a stumbling block. </p> <p>She said to her husband: “It’s no good calling this thing onchocerciasis. If I can’t pronounce it or spell it, I certainly can’t raise funds for it. It comes from the river, so let’s call it ‘river blindness’.” The name immediately caught on, and the disease became known by her name for it.</p>    <p>By 1955 the society – later known as the Royal Commonwealth Society of the Blind – had set up national organisations in 20 countries, including Ghana, Nigeria, Barbados and Cyprus, which ran mobile eye clinics to treat river blindness, trachoma and other eye conditions. They also helped fund training schemes for blind farmers, ophthalmic surveys and educational projects. It was not a “top down” organisation: instead, the Wilsons wanted to partner and support local initiatives. </p> <p>Jean had trained as a teacher, and was particularly interested in educating blind children. She had visited schools in America that integrated children with sight loss into ordinary schools and helped set up a similar school in Uganda, but was dismayed that parents often thought a blind child was not worth educating. </p> <p>Something dramatic was required to show how much blind people could achieve, and in 1969 the society arranged for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-47278655\">seven blind men from Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania to climb Kilimanjaro</a>. The expedition was covered widely by African newspapers and helped to convince parents that it was worth allowing their blind child to attend school. </p> <p>John was knighted in 1975, bringing Jean the courtesy title of Lady Wilson. She was made OBE in 1981, and two years later they both </p> <p>stepped down from Sightsavers, deciding to use their experience to tackle disability more widely. In 1981 Wilson had organised the Leeds Castle international seminar on the prevention of disablement as part of the United Nations’ International Year of Disabled Persons. </p> <p>After this, the Wilsons and their daughter Claire Hicks set up <a href=\"https://impact.org.uk/\">Impact</a> in 1985 to address the whole spectrum of disability, including sight and hearing loss, physical disability and other conditions. Like Sightsavers, Impact partners with local organisations; in a flagship project in 1991, it collaborated with Indian Railways to launch the Lifeline Express, the world’s first hospital train. Last year alone nearly one million people benefited from Impact’s programmes.</p> <p>Wilson passionately believed that much disability could be avoided through education and immunisation. The disease rubella during pregnancy can result in blindness and deafness in unborn babies, and in 1983 she became chair of the UK’s National Rubella Council, which ran education programmes to increase uptake of the rubella vaccine. She recruited prominent women such as Diana, Princess of Wales and Linda McCartney to publicise the campaign, and in four years they significantly increased rates of vaccination among women and girls.</p> <p>Born in Acton, west London, Jean was the only child of Chloe (nee Byway) and John McDermid, and attended Harrow county school for girls. Her father worked in public health for Kensington and Chelsea borough council, but he died when she was 16.

She followed this with a teaching diploma at the London Institute of Education in 1945. She and John initially lived in London on the Finchley Road, where she had Claire in 1948 and Jane in 1953. In 1955 the family moved to a house near Rottingdean in Sussex, which was Jean’s base for the rest of her life and where she loved to garden.</p> <p>John died in 1999. He had chaired the Hearing Conservation Council and Jean took over as chair. She also remained closely associated with her charities, serving as vice-president of Sightsavers and honorary president of Impact to the end of her life, and she continued to travel widely into her 90s.

At an hour and 47 minutes, this was the longest State of the Union address in history. As he has so often done in the past, Trump bobbed and weaved impressively (“the weave” is his own term for his meandering speaking style). He zigged and zagged, taunting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> for much of the speech (he called Zohran Mamdani a “communist” and took pot shots at Democrats throughout the night), while claiming to be a unifier when the mood struck.</p> <p>He was alert at times, working the room like a borscht belt comic, calling out friends, delivering jabs to enemies – the menacing Jerry Lewis of The King of Comedy. But for long stretches, he read robotically from the teleprompter, as if tired by the ordeal of going up to Capitol Hill.</p> <p>To be sure, he had his work cut out. This was a major opportunity for a reset, a little more than half a year before the midterms. He needed one. Trump’s approval ratings have cratered in recent weeks, due to outrage over killings of American citizens by federal immigration agents, and an incoherent foreign policy that has confused his Maga base and alienated most of our traditional allies.</p> <p>A president who once swore to avoid forever wars is now deeply enmeshed in Iran, where a US flotilla is prepared to launch airstrikes, and in the Caribbean. His “Board of Peace” has failed to win over America’s closest allies, and threatens to degrade the United Nations and an international Pax Americana once created by Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/24/trump-state-of-union-speech-analysis\">Why the longest-ever State of the Union address was the most inconsequential</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His tariff policy is deeply unpopular, among Republicans as well as Democrats, and there are signs of a “Trump slump” coming in, dragging down the economy. A recent report stated that the US has lost 108,000 manufacturing jobs in the last year, despite Trump’s promises that his tariffs would bring factories “roaring back”.</p> <p>In short, reality bites. Trump continues to lash out at enemies, and the previous administration, but it has been a year of Republican control and the American people can see clearly that he is not delivering. More than two-thirds of Americans – 68% – say that he hasn’t paid attention to important problems, and he is hemorrhaging independent voters. More than half of voters – 57 % – disapprove of his handling of the economy. He tried to claim that he inherited a bad economy, but that is easily disproven (the Economist called the US economy “the envy of the world” in October 2024).</p> <p>Trump came into the Capitol hoping to distract from these problems, and to an extent, he did. There were the usual cultural attacks, and more than a few “Lenny Skutniks”, the name given to an outside hero figure (after a precedent created by Ronald Reagan in 1982, honoring a civilian who jumped into a frozen Potomac to rescue a plane crash survivor). In this case, the members of the US men’s hockey team, who were cheered lustily, were the marquee attraction. Trump also talked about American history, including the 250th anniversary celebration beginning this year, and the second world war (several veterans were in the chamber).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The result was a Bataan death march at times, and a long speech in search of a point</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the result was a Bataan death march at times, and a long speech in search of a point. The State of the Union address has been in decline for decades, as a TV spectacle, and Trump probably hastened that trend.</p> <p>Can anyone remember a single one of his addresses from his first term? Tonight will be no different. He ignored topics of great relevance in the days ahead (Are we going to war in Iran? Can we say something to meaningful to Ukraine on the fourth anniversary of Putin’s invasion?), while meandering about private obsessions of dubious relevance.</p> <p>He claimed that the US was the “hottest” country while ignoring steep declines in favorability ratings. He denounced immigrants while failing to speak about a topic very much on the minds of Americans, the killing of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. That omission feels all the more striking at a time when so many Americans are wondering about a justice system that seems rigged to reward the wealthy, and to forget everyone else, as in the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p> <p>In other ways, too, “the weave” seemed to be running out of steam. At times, Trump seemed to think Nancy Pelosi was still speaker of the House. Far from “defeating” affordability, as he claimed, Trump seems overmatched by it. The price of hamburger is up 17.2% from a year ago. Coffee has increased by 18.3%. Nearly two-thirds of Americans – 65% – are unable to afford a median-priced home. The Trump-led expiration of healthcare subsidies will make healthcare unaffordable to millions. At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act delivered a trillion dollars in tax cuts to the top 1%.</p> <p>Trump spoke often of 1776, and the beginning of the anniversary year. He is far from the first president to do so. But 1776 is also the year that Edward Gibbon wrote his classic History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In that work, Gibbon wondered why a great people had allowed their civic institutions to wither. He then answered his own question.</p> <p>They blamed anyone but themselves for their problems, usually fixating on foreigners. They abandoned their libraries and cultural institutions, and were drawn to “circuses and theatres” for sensational entertainments. They also tore down a lot of their better civic buildings. As Gibbon put it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The monuments of consular, or Imperial, greatness were no longer revered, as the immortal glory of the capital: they were only esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials, cheaper, and more convenient than the distant quarry. Specious petitions were continually addressed to the easy magistrates of Rome, which stated the want of stones or bricks, for some necessary service: the fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced, for the sake of some paltry, or pretended, repairs; and the degenerate Romans, who converted the spoil to their own emolument, demolished, with sacrilegious hands, the labors of their ancestors.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sound familiar?</p> <ul> <li><p>Ted Widmer is a historian and a former White House speechwriter (in the Clinton administration).

It was eight years fighting for full justice.</p> <p>“Today Brazil’s justice system honoured the memory of Marielle and Anderson. Brazil begins a new historic chapter in confronting political violence based on gender and race. Impunity cannot be part of our democracy,” added Anielle, who is minister for racial equality in the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.</p> <p>Announcing her vote, Justice Cármen Lúcia said the proceedings had been “very painful” for her.</p> <p>“Human justice is not capable of soothing this pain. This trial is merely a timid, almost embarrassed testimony on my part of the response the law can offer in the face of the searing, atrocious pain borne on the faces of the mother, the daughter, the son, the widows,” added Lúcia, referring to the relatives of Franco and Gomes, who were present in the courtroom.</p> <p>The long journey of almost a decade to secure the convictions was marked by a tortuous series of twists that included the destruction of evidence, frequent changes in lead investigators and even the revelation that the then head of the homicide division, Rivaldo Barbosa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/26/marielle-franco-assassination-brazil-rio-police-arrests\">actively worked to obstruct the investigation</a>.</p> <p>Barbosa was not convicted of murder on Wednesday, as the justices found there was insufficient evidence that he had taken part in the killings, but he was found guilty on the lesser charges of obstruction of justice and corruption for having received bribes from the Brazão brothers.</p> <p>The case was tried by the supreme court because Chiquinho was a congressman when his involvement was uncovered. The convictions came more than a year after two former police officers who carried out the killings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/marielle-franco-brazil-murder-former-police-officers-sentenced\">were sentenced by a court in Rio.</a></p> <p>Ronnie Lessa, who fired the shots in the drive-by shooting, and Élcio de Queiroz, who drove the getaway car, were sentenced in October 2024 to decades in prison, but their sentences were reduced to a maximum of 30 years after they confessed and cooperated with investigators.</p> <p>Lessa, regarded as one of Rio’s most ruthless hitmen, said he had been hired by the Brazão brothers – long accused of involvement with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/brazil-militia-paramilitary-wield-terror-seize-power-from-drug-gangs\">paramilitary mafia groups known as militias</a> – to kill Franco after becoming frustrated by her efforts to disrupt lucrative housing development schemes.</p> <p>“Marielle Franco became a highly significant obstacle to the economic and political interests of those who ordered the crime,” said the rapporteur, Justice Alexandre de Moraes.</p> <p>One of the most profitable activities of the militia led by the Brazão brothers was the illegal occupation of land – much of it in environmentally protected areas – followed by property development and the provision of services such as electricity and internet.</p> <p>Franco, who at the time served alongside Chiquinho on Rio’s city council, was a vocal advocate for housing rights and frequently warned residents not to join new illegal projects created by the militia.</p> <p>“Marielle Franco was a Black, poor woman who was confronting the interests of militiamen,” said Moraes. “What stronger message could they send? In the misogynistic, prejudiced minds of those who ordered and carried out the killing, who would care about this [her murder]?”</p> <p>The Brazão brothers’ lawyers focused their defence on attempting to discredit Lessa’s confession, arguing that there was no other evidence of their involvement in the crimes. However, all the justices agreed that, beyond the testimony, there was “abundant evidence” to support their convictions.</p> <p>Two former police officers were also convicted: Ronald Paulo de Alves Pereira, for monitoring Franco’s routine in the days leading up to the crime; and Robson Calixto Fonseca, known as The Fish, who will answer only for armed criminal organisation for having delivered the murder weapon to Lessa.</p> <p>Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International in Brazil, said the convictions were “a fundamental milestone, a chance to turn the page in the history of Rio and Brazil”.</p> <p>“First, because it affirms the need to protect human rights defenders. Fighting for rights cannot cost lives … Second, this decision also marks a turning point in the fight against impunity, so that crimes like this are not repeated,” she said.</p>","subtitle":"João Francisco Inácio Brazão and Domingos Inácio Brazão sentenced for murder of Marielle Franco, a gay Black woman and rising political star","cover_image_url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/142e363f16a99e12997091330330f7efac860f42/0_0_2961_2368/500.jpg","cover_aspect_ratio":"4:3","author_id":"source-guardian","author":{"id":"source-tiago rogero","email":"source-tiago rogero@inkboard.eu","username":"source-tiago rogero","display_name":"Tiago Rogero","avatar_url":"https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/initials/svg?seed=Tiago%20Rogero","role":"USER","is_verified":true,"is_suspended":false,"created_at":"2026-02-25T18:20:33.025Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"total_likes":0,"post_count":0},"tags":[{"id":"World news","name":"world news","post_count":1}],"source_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/25/brazil-politician-brothers-convicted-murder","published_at":"2026-02-25T17:29:52Z","created_at":"2026-02-25T17:29:52Z","read_time_minutes":7,"source":"guardian","status":"PUBLISHED","engagement_score":100,"like_count":39,"comment_count":9,"share_count":0,"is_trending":false},{"id":"guardian-politics-live-2026-feb-25-gorton-and-denton-byelection-campaign-greens-labour-reform-uk-politics-latest-news-updates","title":"Foreign Office denies minister’s claim the Chagos Islands deal has been paused – as it happened","content":"<div id=\"block-699f303f8f080f3523777b58\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2026-02-25T17:30:46.836Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/25/confusion-over-chagos-islands-deal-as-foreign-office-denies-handover-paused\">Plans to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius are still on track, the UK government has insisted, after a minister caused confusion by telling MPs that the deal was “paused”.</a></strong></p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2026/feb/25/ministers-explore-easing-burden-student-loans-university-graduates\">Ministers are examining ways to ease the burden of student loans after weeks of pressure over a policy pulling more people into repayments, the Guardian understands.</a></strong></p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/25/ed-davey-accuses-william-blake-house-care-home-trustee-embezzlement\">Ed Davey has accused a trustee of a learning disability care home of embezzlement and called for watchdogs to take over the charity to resolve a crisis he described as “one my worst nightmares”.</a></strong></p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/25/trtreasury-blair-thinktank-advise-on-ai-use-public-services\">Ministers have called in Tony Blair’s thinktank and private tech companies to guide them on deploying AI across the UK government in a move campaigners compared to “inviting in foxes to consult on the future of the henhouse”.</a></strong></p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p><em>For a full list of all the stories covered on the blog today, do scroll through the list of key event headlines near the top of the blog.</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-699f2db18f08255e300526df\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-sabbagh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2026-02-25T17:19:36.871Z\">5.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Unite general secretary Sharon Graham says Reeves should be moved if she does not back multi-billion defence investment</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Dan Sabbagh is the Guardian’s defence and security editor.</em></p> \n  <p>The head of Britain’s largest trade union demanded that Rachel Reeves be reshuffled or sacked from her job as chancellor if the Treasury continues to hold up a multi-billion defence investment plan.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sharon Graham</strong>, the general secretary of Unite, warned that tens of thousands of jobs were at risk from political dithering and called on ministers to “back British industry,” by signing off on future defence contracts.</p> \n  <p>She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If Rachel Reeves can’t grasp that concept and doesn’t care where things are made, then she should go.

Farage was not involved in the Vote Leave campaign, and after the referendum he claimed he had never approved of the £350m a week claim and <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-06-24/farage-350m-a-week-slogan-was-a-mistake/\">regarded it as a “mistake”</a>. </p> \n  <p>But Farage did as much as anyone to ensure that Britain did vote to leave the EU in 2016, and there were other claims that he did make about Brexit where the alleged benefits have failed to materialise. It is notable that now Farage does not speak much about that process at all, and he changed the name of his party from the Brexit party to Reform UK.</p> \n  <p>The Labour advert is also notable because, until recently, Labour has been reluctant to say anything critical of the Vote Leave campaign because it has been worried about offending pro-Brexit Labour supports.</p> \n  <p>When Morgan McSweeney was Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, he was one of the Labour figures more nervous about sounding anti-Brexit.

We have never set a deadline.

With the polling booths about to open, the crude sloganising gets even more extreme. Today was a good example.</p> \n  <p>Kemi Badenoch started quite well. At the weekend she announced a plan to cut the interest graduates pay on their student loans. She was responding to increasing media interest in student loans in recent weeks (triggered by the freeze in the loan repayment threshold coming into force in April). But ministers have noticed this too, and they are already looking at the issue, as <strong>Will Hazell</strong> explains in <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/student-loan-changes-considered-treasury-tackle-debt-crisis-4254409\">a story in the i</a> today which includes this wonderful quote.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One source with knowledge of discussions said that Treasury officials were “beavering away trying to work out if there is a different combination of the interest rate and the threshold level that makes increasingly influential young graduates stop shouting at them”.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Badenoch got Starmer to concede that the government is considering changing the loan rules. She taunted him quite effectively over Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, saying before the general election “graduates, you will pay less under a Labour government.” And she was a bit more explicit than she has been in the past about disowning the policy failures of the past government.

But her “paedo protection party” jibe was crude and excessive, and towards the end she had lapsed into low-grade insults. Another problem was that, in exchanges that were relatively routine and unmemorable, Starmer had the best line; this came when he responded to her boast about Tory MPs being under new leadership by making the point that some of them were – because they now have Nigel Farage as their boss.</p> \n  <p>Towards the end Starmer described Badenoch as “utterly irrelevant”. In some respects that is just regular abuse but, as the Gorton and Denton byelecton illustrates (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/feb/25/gorton-and-denton-byelection-campaign-greens-labour-reform-uk-politics-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-699eacca8f089504d803c4ac#block-699eacca8f089504d803c4ac\">9.11am</a>), two-party politics in the UK has been upended and increasingly that sounds like a structural complaint about the way PMQs is organised.</p> \n  <p>All the focus is on the Starmer/Badenoch exchanges because she is the only MP who gets six questions.

Prospects have never looked bleaker for the mainstream parties who have dominated British politics for so long - both may soon fall out of the top two in national polling, both face annihilation in the May local and devolved elections, and as the tide of revolt rises everywhere there are no safe seats left for either party’s MPs or local councillors ….</p> \n   <p>Whichever party emerges victorious on Friday, we may come to see this as the day Labour’s electoral Tinkerbell dies.

It is the last full day of campaigning in the Gorton and Denton byelection and a new poll is out which suggests – that it is too close to call, and that the Green party, Labour and Reform UK all have a credible chance of winning.</p> \n  <p>The data is a bit more specific than that. Opinium has done the poll <a href=\"https://bylinetimes.com/2026/02/24/exclusive-poll-anti-reform-tactical-voters-poised-to-defeat-nigel-farages-party-in-gorton-and-denton-by-election/\">for Byline Times</a> and Forward Democracy and the figures show a dead heat amongst all voters (the Greens and Labour on 28%, Reform UK on 27%), but the Greens (30%) marginally ahead of Labour and Reform UK (both on 28%) amongst people likely to vote.</p> \n  <p>This is the second poll suggesting the Greens are marginally ahead. An <a href=\"https://theweekinpolls.substack.com/p/gorton-and-denton-parliamentary-by\">Omnisis poll </a>at the end of last week had the Greens on 33%, Reform UK on 29% and Labour on 26%. But constituency polling can be very erratic, and most of these leads are within the margin of error, and so the only reliable takeaway with regard to the result is – it’s too close to call.</p> \n  <p>But there is another takeaway that is reliable. In what traditionally has been a safe Labour seat, there are two insurgent, challenger parties that are competitive. We are used to byelections where one outsider party is doing well, but here Reform UK and the Greens are both potential winners. This is further confirmation that the two-party system has completely broken down, and we are now in an era of multi-party politics.</p> \n  <p>There is also another, apparently solid finding in the Opinium polling. <strong>Adam Bienkov</strong> reports in <a href=\"https://bylinetimes.com/2026/02/24/exclusive-poll-anti-reform-tactical-voters-poised-to-defeat-nigel-farages-party-in-gorton-and-denton-by-election/\">his write-up for Byline Times</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The poll suggests that tactical <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/vrj2m/https://bylinetimes.com/2024/09/10/scrap-callous-photo-id-scheme-campaigners-demand-as-report-reveals-scale-of-voter-suppression/\">voting</a> could easily swing the contest, with anti-Reform voters significantly more likely to switch to the Greens than to Labour.</p> \n   <p>Around two thirds (66%) of those Labour and Liberal Democrat voters surveyed said they would be prepared to switch to the Greens if they were the party most likely to beat Reform, compared to just 41% of Green and Lib Dem voters who said they would switch to Labour to defeat Farage’s party.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Commenting on the poll, James Crouch, head of policy and public affairs at <strong>Opinium</strong>, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Gorton &amp; Denton by-election is shaping up to be an incredibly tight and unpredictable three-way race, with this latest poll also suggesting the Greens could benefit more than Labour from tactical voting in the final days of the campaign.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>We will hear more about this at PMQs.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>Noon:</em> Keir Starmer faces Kemi Badenoch at PMQs.</p> \n  <p><em>Afternoon:</em> Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is on a visit where she is talking about the Ofgem price cap announcement.</p> \n  <p>And the government is publishing its courts and tribunals bill today.</p> \n  <p>If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media.

For too long, access to arts and culture has been shaped by postcode and privilege. Creative subjects have been progressively squeezed out of state schools, while youth clubs, local theatres and grassroots arts organisations have weathered years of funding cuts.

The creative industries are one of the UK’s fastest-growing sectors and a powerful driver of social mobility.

At least Jesus never thought he was Tony Blair, 18 February</a>). The last episode was the saddest, as Tony’s friends and family mithered about his legacy. Like all premierships, the Blair years were a mixed blessing – some great domestic policy, largely pushed by Gordon Brown, and a patchy foreign policy.</p> <p>But Tony’s biggest legacy would be the destruction of the coalition that had been the Labour party for the previous 90 years. I joined Labour in 1966. During those years we accepted that there would be different factions within the party. Occasionally, we had to show the door to various Trotskyite groups and careerists, but to say that the Labour party was something of a family is no exaggeration.</p> <p>Sadly, Blair and his faction saw any questioning of his approach as treason. I know, because when I publicly questioned his gimmick of ditching public ownership, I felt the full force of a ferocious personal attack that led me to being deselected as a Labour member of the European parliament.</p> <p>Just to make certain that Labour MEPs were under his personal control, his Labour government engineered an extreme form of proportional representation that gave Nigel Farage and Ukip their first parliamentary platform.

I did not grow up in the UK, and I am not accustomed to writing about public policy. Where I come from, policy can feel like the weather: when the sun shines, one enjoys it; when storms arrive, one complains – but few imagine they can change it. Perhaps I still carry some of that temperament.</p> <p>So I write not in the hope of shaping national strategy, but because certain perspectives deserve to be heard. Mine is that of an international early-career scientist working in the UK. It may be somewhat representative.</p> <p>I would like to make three points.</p> <p>First, the key to scientific investment is not only the size of the cake, but the stability of its supply. Sudden expansions and contractions are equally damaging. Academic ecosystems, especially in science and engineering, take years to build. From first interest to intellectual independence can take a decade. Sharp funding swings distort the talent market and waste training, potential, and human capital.</p> <p>Second, how should a country respond to technological revolutions? When some invent better tools and rent them at high prices, others produce alternatives and share the blueprints. In such a world, should the UK focus only on ever more sophisticated tools, or also on digging for gold? Surely it would be unwise to reduce the number of people digging while concentrating solely on tool design. One of those goldmines is curiosity-driven science.</p> <p>Third, science has long been a refuge. A mature and prosperous nation should aspire to be a haven for those who expand the frontiers of knowledge.<br><strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Zheng Zhang</strong><br><em>Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester</em></p> <p>• Further to the opinion piece by Jon Butterworth, I would like to clarify details about the justification for the savings programme at the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).</p> <p>While is it true that UKRI more broadly is changing how it delivers its investments, partly to align with government priorities and drive growth after a record settlement from government, STFC faces a unique situation among UK Research and Innovation’s councils.</p> <p>These savings would therefore have been necessary regardless, as STFC’s portfolio faces cost pressures resulting from factors including inflation and an ambitious programme of work from the previous spending review that is no longer affordable. It would be irresponsible to allow forecasted costs to exceed budgets year-on-year, and so we are taking action now to put the STFC portfolio on a long-term sustainable footing.</p> <p>The majority of STFC cost savings across the spending-review period will be borne internally, to protect the wider community as much as possible.</p> <p>However, it is important for all of our research and innovation programmes to take the necessary steps to look at how they may be able to contribute to us making savings across our entire portfolio. As we do this, we are consulting with the research community, including our advisory bodies and technical experts, before we make any decisions. We are committed to keeping the research community informed throughout this process. <br><strong>Prof Michele K Dougherty</strong><strong><br></strong><em>Executive chair, STFC</em></p>","subtitle":"<strong>Letters: </strong>In response to an article by Jon Butterworth, <strong>Prof Michele K Dougherty </strong>writes that the council is putting its portfolio on a sustainable footing ","cover_image_url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/95c38b2e0087dbeecd555102a2e6db33b370ab5f/500_0_5000_4000/500.jpg","cover_aspect_ratio":"4:3","author_id":"source-guardian","author":{"id":"source-the guardian writer","email":"source-the guardian writer@inkboard.eu","username":"source-the guardian writer","display_name":"The Guardian Writer","avatar_url":"https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/initials/svg?seed=The%20Guardian%20Writer","role":"USER","is_verified":true,"is_suspended":false,"created_at":"2026-02-25T18:20:33.023Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"total_likes":0,"post_count":0},"tags":[{"id":"Science","name":"science","post_count":1}],"source_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2026/feb/25/concerns-over-funding-for-science-in-the-uk","published_at":"2026-02-25T17:31:43Z","created_at":"2026-02-25T17:31:43Z","read_time_minutes":4,"source":"guardian","status":"PUBLISHED","engagement_score":100,"like_count":382,"comment_count":14,"share_count":0,"is_trending":false},{"id":"guardian-fashion-2026-feb-25-clog-comfort-is-difficult-to-beat","title":"Clog comfort is difficult to beat | Letter","content":"<p>I was interested to see the article about the decline in clog wearing (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/feb/20/experience-last-traditional-clog-maker-england\">Experience: I am the last traditional clog maker in England, 22 February</a>).

After defeat at the battle of Sedgemoor, Monmouth was tried and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. James II spared his nephew from this awful fate. However, the executioner Jack Ketch took more than five strokes of the axe to carry out a less barbaric death&nbsp;sentence of beheading.</p> <p>Second, in 1688, Monmouth’s half-sister Mary and her husband, William III, led a successful challenge to the law of the land, and a less bloody coup.

When you are entitled from birth to all that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor enjoyed, not surprisingly you expect the world to sustain you in the same manner.

It has indeed been painful to watch their struggles with extremes of both privilege and pointlessness. Yet in any family, over the generations there will be a few reprobates.

It remained available despite clips of the racial slur widely circulating on social media.</p> <p>A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC has been reviewing what happened at Bafta on Sunday evening. This was a serious mistake and the director general has instructed the executive complaints unit to complete a fast-tracked investigation and provide a full response to complainants.”</p> <p>The Commons culture, media and sport committee has written to Davie to demand answers about how the mistake was made.</p> <p>Caroline Dinenage, the Conservative chair of the committee, said she understood that the slur was the result of Davidson’s involuntary tics. However, she questioned how it was broadcast despite a two-hour delay.</p> <p>She said the incident had happened despite MPs on the committee previously raising concerns “about circumstances in which the BBC has allowed deeply offensive language to be aired, notably the broadcasting of antisemitic language during the BBC’s coverage of last year’s Glastonbury festival”.</p> <p>The reference is to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/03/bbc-to-drop-high-risk-live-performances-after-bob-vylan-glastonbury-set\">anti-Israel Defense Forces chant</a> led by the musician Bobby Vylan, whose real name is Pascal Robinson-Foster.</p> <p>“This latest incident raises questions about the extent to which lessons have been learned and about the controls and systems you have in place to prevent such incidents,” Dinenage wrote.</p> <p>A critical breakdown of communication between Bafta, broadcasters in the hall and producers editing the coverage from a truck appears to be responsible for the slur being broadcast.</p> <p>Producers caught some of the tics expressed by Davidson, including one other occurrence of the N-word. However, a difference between what could be heard clearly in the hall compared with in the production truck – as well as a confusion over what had been caught and edited out – appear to be the most likely explanations for the failing.</p> <p>Inside the BBC there is as much concern over how long the broadcast containing the slur remained on iPlayer. It was removed only late on Monday morning.</p> <p>Both issues will be examined by the review. Bafta has already announced its own “comprehensive review” of the awards show, which left Jordan and Lindo having to handle the slur while on stage and Davidson saying he felt “deeply mortified”.</p> <p>Davidson was at the award show because of the success of I Swear, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/09/i-swear-review-john-davidson-tourette-syndrome\">the biopic that recounts his struggles with TS</a>. Sources at the studio behind I Swear said they had been reassured by Bafta before the show that any offensive verbal tics would be edited out.</p> <p>Davidson has also questioned why he was seated near one of the microphones at the event.</p> <p>The failure is all the more puzzling given the BBC knew about Davidson’s participation in the show and had been preparing for it.

Concerns over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/feb/23/mexico-guadalajara-world-cup-host-el-mencho-drug-cartel-killing\">hosting of World Cup matches</a> in Mexico.

Is all this really worth it? But then there’s Bodø/Glimt.</p> <p>Tiny, little Bodø/Glimt from the Arctic Circle. The Norwegian miracle club that pulled off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/feb/25/bodo-glimt-bask-crazy-champions-league-victory-shellshocked-inter\">one of the biggest upsets</a> in European soccer history on Tuesday by dumping Internazionale out of the Champions League. The glorious anomaly reminding us all why we fell in love with this stupid sport in the first place.</p> <p>Bodø/Glimt should have stood no chance against Inter. The Serie A leaders and three-time European champions boast a squad worth €666m ($787m), according to Transfermarkt. Bodø/Glimt’s squad, in stark contrast, is valued at just €57m ($67m). Inter are an established superpower over several decades; Bodø/Glimt were in the Norwegian second-tier 10 years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2026/feb/25/bodglimt-stun-inter-and-newcastle-see-off-qarabag-football-weekly\">Bodø/Glimt stun Inter and Newcastle see off Qarabag – Football Weekly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What happened at San Siro on Tuesday was most shocking because it wasn’t at all shocking to anyone who has watched Bodø/Glimt this season. Kjetil Knutsen’s side already had humbled Atlético Madrid and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/20/bodo-glimt-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">Manchester City</a> before beating Inter home and away. Their counterattack is arguably the most potent of any team in Europe. They play with complete conviction no matter the opponent. Inter may not be the last giant to suffer.</p> <p>At a time when inequality at the elite level of European soccer has never been greater, Bodø/Glimt’s success offers a glimmer of hope for the future. Money may determine most things, but not everything. Not all the time. Sometimes David beats Goliath 5-2 on aggregate. The Champions League needed this. Soccer needed this.</p> <h2><strong>Are Arsenal over their title race wobbles?</strong></h2>    <p>In a different timeline, Declan Rice’s mistake for Tottenham Hotspur’s equaliser on Sunday could have been his Steven Gerrard “this does not slip” moment. Just seconds before, the midfielder had gestured for concentration from his Arsenal teammates only for his own to lapse, dribbling into trouble on the edge of his own box. Randal Kolo Muani made him pay.</p> <p>Arsenal’s recent wobbles have been costly. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/feb/18/wolverhampton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">midweek collapse at Wolves</a> hinted at a group of players getting edgy, possibly inhibited by the trauma of past failed title challenges. A nine-point lead became a five-point lead became a two-point lead before Sunday’s north London derby.</p> <p>So when Rice gifted Spurs the equaliser just moments after Arsenal had taken the lead, the visitors could have crumbled completely. Instead, they scored three more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/feb/22/tottenham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">to win 4-1</a>. The footballing task might have been tougher had Tottenham not been without 12 first-team players through injury or suspension, but the mental test was a stern one and Mikel Arteta’s team came through it.</p> <p>Arteta recognised the victory could be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/feb/22/beating-tottenham-can-be-a-turning-point-for-arsenal-says-proud-arteta\">“turning point”</a> in Arsenal’s season. There is hard work ahead for the Gunners if they are to hold off City and win the title. Sunday’s result and performance showed they’re ready for it.</p> <h2><strong>How concerning is Christian Pulisic’s form and fitness?</strong></h2>    <p>Christian Pulisic probably won’t be an Italian champion this season. Milan’s home defeat to Parma on Sunday felt fatal to their Scudetto hopes. There are now 10 points between the Rossoneri and Inter at the top of the Serie A table with Cristian Chivu’s team on a run of 13 wins from their last 14 league games.</p> <p>For a long time, Pulisic was doing more than anyone else to make Milan challengers. The American forward racked up seven league goals by early December when many were calling him the best player in Serie A. Since then, though, Pulisic has netted just once. He’s yet to find the back of the net in 2026.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/feb/25/usmnt-world-cup-players-mauricio-pochettino\">Mauricio Pochettino suddenly has a glut of USMNT options as the World Cup looms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even more concerning than that from a US men’s national team perspective is that Pulisic’s start against Parma on Sunday was his first since 18 January. Stefano Pioli has been managing Pulisic’s minutes for months, careful not to overload a player who is struggling for full fitness after a series of injury issues.</p> <p>Considering Pulisic’s importance to his national team, one wonders how regularly Mauricio Pochettino is in contact with Pioli and the Milan medical staff.

The state’s attorney general </a>alleges the company’s platforms are putting profits over child safety. Meta disputes these allegations, citing changes it has introduced on its platforms, such as teen accounts with default protections. The ICAC taskforce is a nationwide network of law enforcement agencies coordinated with the US Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute online child exploitation and abuse cases.</p> <p>Another ICAC officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, said: “Meta is providing thousands of tips each month. It’s pretty overwhelming because we’re getting so many reports, but the quality of the reports is really lacking in terms of our ability to take serious action.” The ICAC officer added that the total number of cybertips their department had received doubled from 2024 to 2025.</p> <p>The unviable tips from Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, in some instances contain information that is not criminal, both Zweibel and two ICAC officers said. Tips sometimes contain information indicating a crime may have occurred, yet vital images, videos or text are missing or redacted, the anonymous officers added.</p> <p>“[Unviable tips from] Instagram have really skyrocketed recently, especially in the last couple of months, and that’s one of the biggest places where we’re seeing this information not being provided,” the ICAC officer added. “In those cases, we don’t have the information to further the investigation. It weighs on you to know that this crime occurred, but we can’t identify the perpetrator.”</p> <p>Asked about Zweibel’s testimony and the ICAC officers’ remarks, a Meta spokesperson said: “We’ve supported law enforcement to prosecute criminals for years: the DoJ has repeatedly praised our fast cooperation that has helped lead to arrests, and NCMEC has praised our streamlined and ‘improve[d]’ tip reporting process. In 2024, we received over 9,000 emergency requests from US authorities and resolved them within an average of 67 minutes – and even more quickly for cases involving child safety and suicide. Consistent with applicable law, we also report apparent child sexual exploitation imagery to NCMEC and support them to prioritize reports, from helping build their case management tool to labeling cybertips so they know which are urgent.”</p> <p>The company pointed out that the agent, Zweibel, recommended the use of Meta’s teen accounts feature during his testimony, which he said he did “because it is the only option available, assuming that teens will not abstain from the use of social media”.</p> <p>Raúl Torrez, the New Mexico attorney general who is leading the case against Meta, has acknowledged the company’s cooperation in providing leads on child abuse at the trial: “I do want to credit some of the social media applications and platforms, including Meta, to a certain extent they do report images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.”</p> <p>Filings released in the case on Friday show Meta executives sounding internal alarms over the company’s ability to police child sexual abuse and alert law enforcement in early 2019. At the time, the company was preparing to enable end-to-end encryption in Facebook Messenger, which hides users’ messages from anyone but the intended recipient via cryptography.</p> <h2>Filings raise new questions</h2> <p>“We are about to do a bad thing as a company. This is so irresponsible,” wrote Monika Bickert, Meta’s head of content policy.</p> <p>Bickert<strong> </strong>wrote that there would be “no way to find the terror attack planning or child exploitation” if Messenger’s contents were encrypted, which could hinder working with law enforcement. Bickert also said Meta was making “gross misstatements of our ability to conduct safety operations”, according to the internal documents.</p> <p>In another document, Meta employees estimated that encrypting Messenger would have rendered the company “unable to provide data proactively to law enforcement in 600 child exploitation cases, 1,454 sextortion cases, 152 terrorist cases, 9 threatened school shootings”.</p> <p>Andy Stone, a Meta spokesman, told Reuters: “The concerns raised in 2019 represent the very reason we developed a range of new safety features to help detect and prevent abuse, all designed to work in encrypted chats.”</p> <p>Child safety groups criticized the encryption of Messenger, which eventually rolled out in 2023.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/08/facebook-messenger-encryption-child-sexual-abuse\">Child safety groups and prosecutors criticize encryption of Facebook and Messenger</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Reporting child abuse en masse</h2> <p>By law, social media companies based in the United States are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/16/child-sexual-abuse-content-online-ai\">required to report</a> any detected child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on their platforms to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC serves as a national clearinghouse for reports, which it forwards to the appropriate law enforcement agencies across the United States and internationally. NCMEC does not have the authority to filter out any tips that may be unviable before they are sent to the relevant law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>Meta is by far the largest reporter to NCMEC. In its data report for 2024, NCMEC said Meta made 13.8m reports across Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, out of 20.5m tips it received in total.</p> <p>NCMEC said that in 2024, more than 1m CyberTipline reports were linked to a specific US state, and those reports were made available to the ICAC taskforces around the country, as well as other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, for investigation.</p> <p>Meta and other social media companies use AI to detect and report suspicious material on their sites and employ human moderators to review some of the flagged content before sending it to law enforcement. The Guardian has previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/17/child-sexual-abuse-ai-moderator-police-meta-alphabet\">reported that tips generated by AI</a> that haven’t also been reviewed by a social media company employee often cannot be opened by a law enforcement officer without a warrant because of fourth amendment protections. This extra step also slows investigations of potential crimes, lawyers involved in such cases say.</p> <p>A Meta spokesperson said: “It’s unfortunate that court rulings have increased the burden on law enforcement by requiring search warrants to open identical copies of content we’ve already reviewed and reported. Our image-matching system finds copies of known child exploitation at a scale that would be impossible to do manually, and we work to detect new child exploitation content through technology, reports from our community, and investigations by our specialist child safety teams.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/trump-human-trafficking-programs-cut\">Revealed: Trump administration retreats on combating human trafficking and child exploitation</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Legislative change spurs avalanche of tips</h2> <p>Under the Report Act (Revising Existing Procedures On Reporting via Technology), which came into force in November 2024, online service providers must broaden and strengthen their reporting obligations by notifying NCMEC’s CyberTipline not only about child sexual abuse material but also about planned or imminent abuse, child sex trafficking and related exploitation; they must also preserve evidence for a longer period and face higher penalties if they knowingly fail to comply.</p> <p>Since the act passed, the number of unviable tips supplied by Meta has increased dramatically, which could be because the company is acting to ensure it is not falling foul of the law, two ICAC officers said.

I believe you are intelligent enough to recognise this truth, but you choose to not care.”</p> <p>He said Palestinians “will remember everyone who stood with us, and we will remember everyone who stood against us, against our right to live with dignity, or who choose silence or choose to be silent.”</p> <p>In a separate speech, the Lebanese director Marie-Rose Osta criticised Israel while accepting the Golden Bear prize for best short film for Someday a Child.</p> <p>“In reality, children in Gaza, in all of Palestine and in my Lebanon do not have superpowers to protect them from Israeli bombs,” she said, referring to a plot line of her film. “No child should need superpowers to survive a genocide empowered by veto powers and the collapse of international law.”</p> <p>Germany’s environment minister, Carsten Schneider, of the Social Democratic party, reportedly walked out during al-Khatib’s speech, later saying in a statement that he considered the film-maker’s accusations “not acceptable”.</p> <p>Al-Khatib’s remarks also drew condemnation from Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor. Alexander Hoffmann, the parliamentary group leader of the Christian Social Union, partners in Germany’s coalition government, accused al-Khatib of “antisemitic slurs and threats against Germany”.</p> <p>According to sources cited by Bild, Wolfram Weimer, the culture commissioner, decided to relieve Tuttle of her duties after seeing not only the speeches but also a picture taken a week earlier.</p> <p>The photograph showed Tuttle with the Chronicles From the Siege crew, several of whom were wearing keffiyeh scarves and one of whom was displaying a Palestinian flag.</p>    <p>Tuttle, who helmed the BFI London film festival from 2018 to 2022, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.</p> <p>Weimer’s office on Wednesday confirmed that an extraordinary meeting of the KBB supervisory board would be held on Thursday at the culture commissioner’s initiative. “The meeting will include a discussion on the future direction of the Berlinale,” the statement said. “We will not comment on any further speculation.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jan/30/israel-and-the-delusions-of-germanys-memory-culture\">Israel and the delusions of Germany’s ‘memory culture’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the start of Berlinale, the festival organisers had drawn criticism from activists for not positioning itself unambiguously on the war in Gaza. At the opening press conference, the veteran director and jury president, Wim Wenders, rejected the notion that artists and cultural institutions must actively take political stances.</p> <p>“We have to stay out of politics because if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics,” Wenders said. “But we are the counterweight of politics, we are the opposite of politics.

Slater in turn complained the department had been captured by lobbyists for Hewlett Packard Enterprise.</p>    <p>A spokesperson for the justice department referred queries about its response to the letter to Bondi’s previous statement thanking Slater for her service.</p> <p>Still, the department’s lack of response to an earlier request by Raskin in August about the tumult inside the antitrust division appears to have galvanized Democrats to double down on an investigation.</p> <p>The letter also raised questions of a merger between American Express Global Business Travel and CWT Holdings; a merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster; bids by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix\">Netflix</a> and Paramount to acquire Warner Bros Discovery; an appeal against a US district court ruling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a> has a monopoly over online searches.</p> <p>With respect to the American Express deal, the letter said: “It appears the dismissal may have also prevented the disclosure of contacts between DOJ officials and Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with close ties to President Trump where you were a partner until January 2025.”</p> <p>Roger Alford, the former principal deputy to Slater, suggested in freewheeling remarks at a Tech Policy Institute event shortly after he too was pushed out from the antitrust division last year that he expected political lobbying to shape the outcome of the Live Nation matter.</p> <p>“Regarding live nation,” the letter said, “Mr Alford has warned that these firms ‘have paid a bevy of cozy MAGA friends to roam the halls of [DOJ’s] Fifth Floor [which houses the senior leadership offices] in defense of their monopoly abuses.’”</p> <p>An investigation into the circumstances of Slater’s removal could be bruising for Trump allies, seen to have played a role in the saga but are not part of the administration and therefore not protected by an assertion of executive privilege by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> to block their testimony.</p> <p>The people who fit that category are likely to include Mike Davis, a firebrand Republican litigator who was retained by Hewlett Packard Enterprise to advise on the merger and <a href=\"https://x.com/mrddmia/status/2022279474230837686\">took credit for Slater’s removal</a> in posts on X.</p> <p>Davis declined to comment when reached by phone on Wednesday, but he has <a href=\"https://x.com/mrddmia/status/2023137000711508367\">previously posted to X</a>: “Dear Trump Appointees: If Senate Democrats would be upset if you got fired, you should just resign now.

The 33-year-old has always denied doping and in December 2023 she was cleared by an independent tribunal, which found that contaminated meat was the “likely source” of the positive tests.</p> <p>An appeal by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) overturned that ruling, however. In July 2025 Cas reimposed Moore’s original four-year ban, removing the 19 months already served, in a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/15/former-british-womens-doubles-no-1-tara-moore-handed-four-year-doping-ban-tennis\"> ruling that stated she had not sufficiently proven</a> the high levels of nandrolone in her system were accidental.</p> <p>Moore is now suing the WTA for negligence, arguing that it failed to warn<strong> </strong>players about the risk of contamination from eating meat, specifically before the tournament in Bogotá. She is seeking $20m in compensation for what the claim describes as reputational and financial ruin, arguing that the WTA failed in their duty of care to protect athletes.</p> <p>Moore also alleges that the authorities, specifically the ITIA, showed preferential treatment to more high-profile players such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/15/jannik-sinner-banned-from-tennis-for-three-months-in-doping-case-settlement-wada\">Jannik Sinner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/28/iga-swiatek-accepts-one-month-ban-testing-positive-trimetazidine-tennis\">Iga Swiatek</a>, who were handed bans of three months and one month respectively following contamination.</p> <p>The WTA spokesperson said: “We are aware of Tara Moore’s filing in the US District Court and will respond through the appropriate legal process. The arbitration was conducted by a neutral arbitrator, and there is no basis to vacate the arbitrator’s award. We respect the judicial process and will not comment further while the matter is pending.”</p> <p>The ITIA was unavailable for comment.</p> <p>A union source with knowledge of the case told the Guardian: “We’re supporting Tara, as she has been treated appallingly. It appears clear there are different systems in place for different people.”</p> <p>The PTPA dropped its anti-trust lawsuit against Tennis Australia last month after reaching a peace deal ahead of the Australian Open, but is still suing the other three slams and the tours.</p> <p>The court documents state that Tennis Australia has agreed to cooperate with the PTPA against the other tournaments, including providing confidential financial information, in return for being removed from the claim and avoiding liability for potential damages that could reach tens of millions of pounds.</p>","subtitle":"The breakaway players union has thrown its weight behind Tara Moore’s $20m legal battle against the WTA in a new front in tennis’s civil war","cover_image_url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9d8ddd6445c277e1f92f8b26cdffef13c4b2bb9/515_0_2535_2028/500.jpg","cover_aspect_ratio":"4:3","author_id":"source-guardian","author":{"id":"source-exclusive by matt hughes","email":"source-exclusive by matt hughes@inkboard.eu","username":"source-exclusive by matt hughes","display_name":"Exclusive by Matt Hughes","avatar_url":"https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/initials/svg?seed=Exclusive%20by%20Matt%20Hughes","role":"USER","is_verified":true,"is_suspended":false,"created_at":"2026-02-25T18:20:33.015Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"total_likes":0,"post_count":0},"tags":[{"id":"Sport","name":"sport","post_count":1}],"source_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/feb/25/breakaway-union-stands-behind-tara-moores-20m-legal-battle-against-wta","published_at":"2026-02-25T17:50:31Z","created_at":"2026-02-25T17:50:31Z","read_time_minutes":5,"source":"guardian","status":"PUBLISHED","engagement_score":100,"like_count":394,"comment_count":1,"share_count":0,"is_trending":false},{"id":"guardian-us-news-2026-feb-25-larry-summers-resign-harvard","title":"Larry Summers to resign from Harvard after Epstein files revelations","content":"<p>Larry Summers, former president of Harvard University, will resign from teaching at the end of the academic year, a spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian.</p> <p>The news of his formal resignation comes “in connection with the ongoing review by the University of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein that were recently released by the government”, a Harvard spokesperson, Jason Newton, said in a statement.</p> <p>Summers also resigned from his role as co-director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, a position he has held since 2011, according to the spokesperson. He will remain on leave until the end of the academic year. <br><br>The news was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2026/2/25/summers-retire-harvard-epstein/\">the Harvard Crimson</a>, the student newspaper.</p> <p>Summers, a renowned economist and former US treasury secretary, announced in November 2025 that he would stop teaching while the school conducted its investigation. <br><br>In a statement shared with the Guardian, Summers acknowledged that the decision to leave was “difficult”.</p> <p>“I will always be grateful to the thousands of students and colleagues I have been privileged to teach and work with since coming to Harvard as a graduate student 50 years ago,” he added.</p> <p>“Free of formal responsibility, as President Emeritus and a retired professor, I look forward in time to engaging in research, analysis and commentary on a range of global economic issues.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/jeffrey-epstein-larry-summers-emails\">Emails</a> that were released by the US House oversight committee in 2025 reignited questions about Summers’ relationship with Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex-trafficking minors. Many of the messages indicated a friendship that lasted well into 2019. Contact only ended shortly before Epstein was arrested in July of that same year.<br><br>Scrutiny on Summers, who was was once prominent voice in Democratic circles, has intensified over recent months. In addition to serving as former treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, he also was director of the White House national economic council (NEC) from January 2009 until November 2010, where he guided the Obama administration through the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis.</p> <p>In the emails, Summers and Epstein muse on everything from politics and philanthropic endeavors to women. Summers, 71, confided in Epstein about pursuing a romantic relationship with someone who viewed him as an “economic mentor”.</p> <p>In one message from 2018, Epstein refers to himself as Summers’s “wingman”. He also gives the economist advice in a 2019 exchange about his romantic gestures being rebuffed.</p> <p>Summers served as Harvard’s president from 2001 to 2006. Epstein <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/president/news-and-statements-by-president-bacow/2020/report-regarding-jeffrey-epstein-s-connections-to-harvard/\">donated</a> more than $9m to Harvard and its affiliated programs between 1998 and 2008, which overlapped with Summers’s tenure. <strong><br></strong><br>Epstein was also appointed a visiting fellow to conduct research in the university’s department of psychology. The university later concluded Epstein “lacked the academic qualifications visiting fellows typically possess and his application proposed a course of study Epstein was unqualified to pursue”.</p> <p>Harvard stopped accepting Epstein’s donations after he pleaded guilty to child sex offenses in 2008.<strong><br><br></strong></p>","subtitle":"News of former Harvard president’s resignation comes ‘in connection with ongoing review’ of Epstein files","cover_image_url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d2a55d9592e5fa543ab55f33ca2664dc3c01429/605_0_3332_2666/500.jpg","cover_aspect_ratio":"4:3","author_id":"source-guardian","author":{"id":"source-sara braun","email":"source-sara braun@inkboard.eu","username":"source-sara braun","display_name":"Sara Braun","avatar_url":"https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/initials/svg?seed=Sara%20Braun","role":"USER","is_verified":true,"is_suspended":false,"created_at":"2026-02-25T18:20:33.015Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"total_likes":0,"post_count":0},"tags":[{"id":"Education","name":"education","post_count":1}],"source_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/25/larry-summers-resign-harvard","published_at":"2026-02-25T17:52:13Z","created_at":"2026-02-25T17:52:13Z","read_time_minutes":4,"source":"guardian","status":"PUBLISHED","engagement_score":100,"like_count":243,"comment_count":47,"share_count":0,"is_trending":true},{"id":"guardian-news-2026-feb-25-heavy-lies-the-crown-inside-the-27-february-edition","title":"Heavy lies the crown: inside the 27 February edition","content":"<p>The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor last week, after allegations he had shared confidential information with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, sent shock waves around the world.</p> <p>What happens next is unclear, but the ramifications will go far beyond the former prince, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.

Unfortunately, the current climate – higher interest rates, inflationary pressures and a more cautious property market – has meant the model no longer meets the partnership’s investment criteria.</p> <p>“Since we embarked on the rental property plans in 2020, we have made significant progress with our core retail strategy.

So I think the public have always been looking forward and they’re not really nostalgic for the past,” Kyle told reporters.</p> <p>Among the initiatives the UK would like to join is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/12/eu-leaders-clash-buy-european-belgium-summit\">“Made in Europe” scheme</a>, expected to be announced next week. It will prioritise European products in public procurement, but there remains tension around the exact quantity of goods that should be European in procurement contracts.</p> <p>The French-led European Commission’s push was originally scheduled to be presented on Thursday but has been the subject of lobbying from opponents within the EU, who believe France is being too protectionist.</p> <p>Ribera said the role of the Industrial Accelerator Act was to strengthen the EU’s resilience and loosen dependence on foreign countries in a scheme that could increase local employment and wealth creation.</p> <p>Asked whether the UK would be part of the deal when it was unveiled, she said she did not do “spoilers”. Personally, she added, she always fought battles in favour of “friendships, mutual cooperation and enhanced prosperity and fairness for all”.</p> <p>Kyle said he was in Brussels not to demand a slice of the action, but to listen. “I am not coming here to lecture or to cherrypick but to talk about all the really exciting things happening in Britain … particularly when it comes to manufacturing,” he said, citing existing UK-EU cooperation on Airbus.</p> <p>He said the trade and cooperation agreement secured by the former prime minister Boris Johnson was “not comprehensive enough or ambitious enough” and it was imperative to improve on that as both sides shared the same challenges.</p> <p>His remarks came as the EU parliament president, Roberta Metsola, said that the UK and Britain must go “even further” than the Brexit reset.</p> <p>Kyle, asked about the disruption to the US trade deal, said he hoped that there would be “clarity” in the “coming days” from the US administration, which might return to the principles of the trade deal secured last May with Donald Trump.</p> <p>The US trade representative Jamieson Greer told Bloomberg TV in the US that he intended to stick to the 10% tariff the UK had secured.</p> <p>“The point is to recreate the policy that we’ve developed over the past year, to give continuity and be able to be in a position where we can honour the deals, but also have enforcement available,” he said.</p>","subtitle":"Peter Kyle signs cooperation deal on competition and says there is little nostalgia for pre-Brexit

department on the removal of <strong>Gail Slater</strong>, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/12/us-antitrust-gail-slater-ousted-trump-administration\">forced to resign as head of the antitrust division</a> this month under a cloud of controversy and fraught tensions with her bosses inside the Trump administration.</p> <p>The request from <strong>Jamie Raskin</strong>, the top Democrat on the House judiciary committee, and <strong>Jerry Nadler</strong>, a Democratic New York congressman, marked the first step in what is almost certain to become a much larger investigation should Democrats reclaim the House majority in the midterm elections and gain subpoena power.</p> <p>In a letter to the attorney general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi\">Pam Bondi</a>, Raskin sought a briefing on the role of Trump-connected lobbyists in Slater’s removal, after she tried to block a $14bn merger between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks, a cloud-computing and software company.</p> <p>“With the departure of AAG Slater, it appears there are no longer any principled antitrust experts left to guard the antitrust division from this cascade of corruption,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27413089-2026-02-25-raskin-nadler-to-bondi-doj-re-antitrust-division/\">the letter said</a>. “The leadership vacuum is occurring just as the antitrust division is handling historic cases.”</p>    <p>Slater was pushed out after her relationship with Bondi and <strong>JD Vance</strong> – once her most powerful ally <a

deteriorated off the back of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise case, the Guardian has previously reported.</p> <p>Among other things, Slater had told Bondi that the US intelligence community never raised national security concerns about stopping the deal. But her claim was contradicted by John Ratcliffe, the CIA director who questioned why he had not been consulted.</p> <p>An exasperated Bondi later told associates she felt Slater had lied to her to continue with the suit, which the justice department dropped in June 2025 in favor of negotiating a settlement. Slater in turn complained the department had been captured by lobbyists for Hewlett Packard Enterprise.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the justice department referred queries about its response to the letter to Bondi’s previous statement thanking Slater for her service.</p> <p><em>More on this story here:</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/25/house-democrats-antitrust-gail-slater-inquiry\">House Democrats open inquiry into ouster of US antitrust chief Gail Slater</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-699f31d38f08255e3005272f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2026-02-25T17:50:04.401Z\">5.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rubio begins talks with Caribbean leaders calling for ‘de-escalation and dialogue’ amid US oil embargo on Cuba</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US secretary of state, <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, arrived in the Caribbean today to begin talks with regional leaders who are calling for “de-escalation and dialogue” to deal with the impact of recent US policies and a growing humanitarian crisis in <strong>Cuba</strong> that could destabilize their region.</p> <p>It comes amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/23/latest-boat-strike-caribbean-kills-three-men\">continued deadly US military strikes</a> against alleged drug boats and the Trump administration’s oil blockade on Cuba.

Apart from our fraternal care and solidarity with the Cuban people, it must be clear that <strong>a prolonged crisis in Cuba will not remain confined to Cuba</strong>. <strong>It will affect migration, security and economic stability across the Caribbean basin</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Trump administration has been pressuring countries to stop participating in the Cuban medics program – which is a source of foreign currency for the Cuban government – chill relations with China and consider allowing US military hardware in their countries.

As my colleague <strong>Hugo Lowell</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/23/trump-iran-airstrikes-nuclear-deal\">reported earlier this week</a>, Trump’s decision to order airstrikes against Iran will hinge in part on the judgment of his special envoys, <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong> and <strong>Jared Kushner</strong>, about whether Tehran is stalling over a deal to relinquish its capacity to produce nuclear weapons.</p> <p>In his Fox News interview, Vance sidestepped a question on whether any of what he said means that Iran’s supreme leader, <strong>Ali Khamenei,</strong> has to go. It has been reported that if there is no deal, Trump has told advisers he is considering limited strikes to pressure Iran and, failing that, a far larger attack to force regime change.</p> <p>“The president ultimately will make the decision about how to ensure Iran does not have a nuclear weapon,” Vance said. “We’re sitting down having another round of diplomatic talks with the Iranians trying to reach a reasonable settlement.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2026-02-25T17:30:30.292Z\">at 5.30pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-699f25c38f08255e30052635\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2026-02-25T16:55:19.372Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">House speaker calls allegations against Gonzales 'detestable' and says he'll speak to him 'hopefully today'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In comments pretty similar to what he said yesterday, the House speaker, <strong>Mike Johnson</strong>, has said that he would meet with <strong>Tony Gonzales</strong> “hopefully today” but that he would let the “due process here to play out as always”.</p> <p>CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-state-of-the-union-2026?post-id=cmm2947bx00073b6srijiies5\">reported</a> Johnson as saying this morning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>The allegations are alarming and detestable</strong>, and I’ve said to him publicly and privately, he’s got to address that directly and head-on with his constituents.

Why wouldn’t it be? If it had access to the code, understands the requirements, and has been trained on previous human input, it’s perfectly capable of completing the task. You however, are left wondering: <em>What’s the point of me doing this anymore?</em></p>\n<p>This isn’t a hypothetical scenario anymore. As AI rapidly reshapes software development landscape, a large percentage of engineers face a clear choice: evolve and bring strategic value or risk being replaced.</p>\n<p>With tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and other LLM-based workflows, much of the repetitive coding, bug-fixing, and routine feature development can be automated. Engineers who focus solely on picking up tickets (or narrowly defined tasks) are setting themselves up to become obsolete.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ticket Engineer Trap</strong></p>\n<p>Picture a typical workday in a large enterprise. You log in, grab a task from the backlog, implement a solution, and move on. There’s no room for reflection, no question of why this task is important or if there's a better approach. You’re simply executing orders, day in and day out. It’s a reactive, task-based routine and it's where many engineers get stuck. These engineers are often the first to face layoffs when companies need to trim their teams.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>AI excels at predictable tasks:</strong></p>\n<p> AI shines when it comes to predictable tasks with explicit instructions. Give it a ticket with clear, well-defined requirements, and it will churn out code faster and often more accurately than you could. If your role is to execute these tasks, you’re competing directly with LLMs and ultimately, you’re losing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>There is no room for creativity or leadership:</strong></p>\n<p> As a ticket engineer, you rarely get involved in the creative parts of the process: system design, architectural decisions, and product innovation. These are the areas where human ingenuity thrives and where AI still falls short. If you’re absent from these discussions, you're sidelining your career potential.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Limited ownership breeds stagnation:</strong></p>\n<p> Limited ownership in development is akin to working at an assembly line, churning out parts without envisioning the final product. By only working within narrow boundaries, you miss out on broader, cross-functional experiences that can enhance your skill set like product thinking, UX design, and business strategy. This lack of exposure can restrict your value within the team and your future opportunities.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"heading-the-solution-be-value-oriented\">The solution: Be value-oriented.</h2>\n<p>For every ticket you pick up, pause for a moment and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Why is this important?</em></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>What value does it bring to the user?</em></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Is there a better solution?</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By understanding the intent behind a task, you’ll not only be able to implement it more effectively, but you’ll also be able to propose better solutions or even eliminate unnecessary work. This is how you demonstrate strategic thinking as an engineer not just by executing tasks but solving problems in a way that drives real impact.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Work cross-functionally</strong></p>\n<p> If possible, work with designers and product managers to understand the bigger picture behind the tasks that you’re assigned. Early on in the design process, you could offer suggestions and even influence the final product rather than merely carrying them out. Consider yourself a user, foresee potential problems, provide suggestions for UI/UX enhancements, and make sure your work satisfies user needs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Upskill in areas AI can’t easily replace</strong></p>\n<p> Learn how to design systems that are scalable, effective, and maintainable to make sure you’re contributing at a level AI isn’t equipped to reach yet. Communication, leadership, and mentoring are also human-centric qualities that AI finds difficult to mimic. In technical discussions, code reviews, and team alignment, take the initiative.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Learn to leverage AI</strong></p>\n<p> But don’t just view AI as competition and use it to your advantage. I could write an entire post about this one but the key here is in mastering AI tools to exponentially increase your productivity by automating mundane tasks, freeing you up to focus on more complex challenges.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p>I recently came across a post on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://app.daily.dev/posts/you-get-paid-based-on-the-level-of-abstraction-you-can-work-at--soryhdhti\">daily.dev by Saqib Tahir</a> that helped me visualize the journey from task-oriented work to strategic ownership. The post breaks down the seniority progression into six levels:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Level 1:</strong> Here’s the problem, the solution, and how to implement it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Level 2:</strong> Here’s the problem and the solution. Figure out how to implement it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Level 3:</strong> Here’s the problem. Figure out the solution.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Level 4:</strong> Here’s a list of problems. Identify the most impactful one to solve.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Level 5:</strong> Find all the problems and determine which are worth solving.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Level 6:</strong> Predict future problems and create systems to prevent them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This progression illustrates what I’m advocating for. Moving from executing tasks to becoming value-oriented is how you climb the seniority ladder. When you think beyond solving immediate problems, identifying, prioritizing, and even preventing them, you’ll not only evolve from being a ticket engineer but also elevate your contribution to the team and accelerate your career growth.</p>\n<p>As an engineering lead at an AI-first company, I’ve seen firsthand the difference between engineers who simply follow orders and those who take ownership of their work. The latter group brings ideas, challenges assumptions, and drives projects forward in ways that no AI tool can. As professionals in a rapidly changing industry, being adaptable is what sets us apart.</p>\n","subtitle":"Imagine one day, you’re scrolling through your Jira tickets, and the latest ones are marked as resolved by AI.

However, ensuring that codebases adhere to these standards requires some work to make this a reality. In this article, I’ll describe the libraries and automations I’ve employed to achieve a polished and organized codebase a reality.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to set up all these tools in a sample project, you can clone this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Cool-Runningz/blog-automate-code-formatting\">GitHub repository</a>. All the examples I provide will assume you're following along with the sample project unless I mention otherwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-benefits\">Benefits</h2>\n<p>Before we dive into <em>how</em> to automate this process, let's first explore <em>why</em> you would want to automate code formatting and linting. Instead of bike-shedding over rules, you can automatically format or lint files using a small set of configuration files. Prettier is used for formatting, and linters are used for catching bugs. ESLint offers a wide range of options, including framework-specific checks and accessibility warnings, to name a few. Both Prettier and ESLint work together to improve the structure and quality of the codebase.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-prettier\">Prettier</h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a> is an opinionated code formatter that integrates with many code editors and supports a variety of programming languages. Prettier intentionally limits the amount of options you can customize so that you spend less time debating styles like whether to use tabs vs. spaces or single quotes vs. double quotes and more time focusing on important things. Simply put, Prettier saves you time and energy by allowing you to agree on a set of configuration options and move on with your day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737250221884/b2017706-8643-47f8-9266-17b51568ae26.png\" alt=\"Prettier logo\" class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-installation-amp-configuration\">Installation &amp; Configuration</h3>\n<p>To install Prettier into your project run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, create an empty config file at the root of your project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">touch .prettierrc.json\n</code></pre>\n<p>This <code>.prettierrc.json</code> file will house the configuration options for our project. To test out a few options, open the file and add the following text to enforce double quotes and semicolons.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-json\">{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"singleQuote\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">false</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"semi\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"heading-testing\">Testing</h3>\n<p>Run the following command at the root of the project to utilize <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli\">Prettier’s CLI</a> and check for any formatting issues in <code>src/counter.js</code>. :</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">npx prettier --check src/counter.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>After checking that file, Prettier will output the following to the terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">Checking formatting...\n[warn] src/counter.js\n[warn] Code style issues found <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">in</span> the above file.

ESLint can detect syntax errors, potential bugs, and deviations from your defined coding style. This tool is widely integrated into many text editors, providing real-time feedback as you write code. Additionally, ESLint can be configured to run as part of your continuous integration pipeline, ensuring that all code changes adhere to your project's quality standards before they are merged. This helps maintain a consistent codebase and reduces the likelihood of introducing errors into your application.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737250298794/aefcb3fc-0b12-4fc2-b8ff-cab98b5a9466.png\" alt=\"ESLint logo\" class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-installation-amp-configuration-1\">Installation &amp; Configuration</h3>\n<p>To install ESLint into your project run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">npm install eslint --save-dev\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can configure ESLint using this command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">npm init @eslint/config@latest\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will prompt you with a series of questions and after installation is complete, create a <code>eslint.config.js</code> file that you can edit and configure to your liking. By default the recommended configuration will be applied and you can configure some rules so that the file looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// eslint.config.js</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> globals <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"globals\"</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> pluginJs <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"@eslint/js\"</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/** @type {import('eslint').Linter.Config[]} */</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">default</span> [\n  {<span class=\"hljs-attr\">languageOptions</span>: { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">globals</span>: globals.browser }},\n  pluginJs.configs.recommended,\n  {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rules</span>: {\n      <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"no-console\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"warn\"</span>\n    }\n  }\n];\n</code></pre>\n<p>The name <code>\"no-console\"</code> is an example of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules\">rule</a> in ESLint.

For example, if I run <code>npx eslint-config-prettier src/counter.js</code>, it will output, <em>“No rules that are unnecessary or conflict with Prettier were found.”</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-testing-1\">Testing</h3>\n<p>Run the following command at the root of the project to utilize <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface\">ESLint’s CLI</a> and check for any formatting issues in <code>counter.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">npx eslint src/counter.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll notice that ESLint does not output anything, indicating that no issues were found. To purposely create an error and a warning, update <code>counter.js</code> to add a <code>console.log()</code> statement and create a new variable without referencing it anywhere.</p>\n<p>If you’re using an editor like VSCode and have the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint\">ESLint extension installed</a>, you might notice that the editor shows the following tooltips when you hover over the code associated with the issues:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737509903628/1ac88dff-2d09-4d1f-b445-058c89d0a7ce.png\" alt=\"VSCode highlighting two ESLint warnings. One warns about an unexpected console statement, and the other notifies that a variable 'empty' is assigned a value but never used.\" /></p>\n<p>However, you can use ESLint’s CLI tool to also check for any issues by running the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">npx eslint src/counter.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>After running the command, the terminal should output the following error and warning messages:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737510280965/bcc28b8e-7da2-4b29-9123-4b33aad9bc58.png\" alt=\"CLI output with two ESLint warnings.

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow, such as before a commit or push. Husky allows you to configure these hooks making it easier to enforce code quality standards, run tests, or perform other tasks automatically as part of the development process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-installation-amp-configuration-2\"><strong>Installation &amp; Configuration</strong></h3>\n<p>To install husky run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">npm install --save-dev husky\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we need to run the <code>init</code> command which will simplify setting up husky in a project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">npx husky init\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a <code>pre-commit</code> script in <code>.husky/</code> and updates the <code>prepare</code> script in <code>package.json</code>. In the next section we’ll see how we can use this to run Prettier and ESLint whenever committing new files.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lint-staged\">lint-staged</h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged\">lint-staged</a> enhances the code quality assurance process by running linters on files that are <strong><em>staged</em></strong> for commit, rather than the entire project. This approach ensures that only the files intended for the next commit are checked, preventing errors from entering the repository and enforcing consistent code style. By focusing on staged files, lint-staged significantly reduces the time and resources required for linting, making it a practical solution for maintaining code quality without unnecessary overhead. The tool provides the ability to execute custom shell tasks on these files, filtered by specified glob patterns, streamlining the pre-commit workflow.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737600311186/59263b80-54b8-4db9-85e3-e30ad0d8923a.png\" alt=\"Sample output from running git commit with a lint-staged configuration\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-installation-amp-configuration-3\">Installation &amp; Configuration</h3>\n<p>Run the following command to install <code>lint-staged</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">npm install --save-dev lint-staged\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we need to setup the <code>pre-commit</code> hook to run lint-staged.

But how can you do this for your AWS Lambda? API Gateway offers usage planes and quotas, so you can put a API in front of the lambda, but quotas have some downsides there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Usage plan throttling and quotas are not hard limits, and are applied on a best-effort basis. In some cases, clients can exceed the quotas that you set. Don’t rely on usage plan quotas or throttling to control costs or block access to an API.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another option is to pair API Gateway, your Lambda and AWS WAF, but if you don’t want to find yourself in the AWS WAF configuration jungle, another simpler option could do the trick for you. Let’s explore how you can easily setup rate limits for your Lambda.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736955448976/c7842dfa-a0ac-4a1e-b9f3-8b9d16e0adb5.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>The above image shows the architecture of the rate-limiter. As I use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://middy.js.org/\">Middy</a> in almost all of my projects for shared middlewares, I built the rate-limiter as a middleware as well. The code is split in two parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Checking for the current quotas of the user and checking it against the allowed quotas in <code>before</code> phase</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Increasing the rate limit after the actual invoke of my API in the <code>after</code> phase</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For storage, I decided to go with something that as fast read and write accesses and in the best case supports TTLs. So a cache made the race and I did go with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gomomento.com/platform/cache/\">momento</a>. You can of course use other caches like Redis or even a database to save the current quotas of a user.</p>\n<p>That is the basics we need to implement rate-limiting. Of course, the allowed quotas have to be defined somewhere and the current quotas have to be stored somewhere. Before we touch on these topics, let’s explore why rate limiting is even needed.</p>\n<div data-node-type=\"callout\">\n<div data-node-type=\"callout-emoji\">ℹ</div>\n<div data-node-type=\"callout-text\">I used the rate limits introduced here for an AppSync API, where I needed to have fixed quotas for certain mutations based on a user’s subscription to the service. Thus, there is no API Gateway involved. You can of course put the middleware code into <strong>API Gateway Lambda authorizers</strong> to check for quotas and increase them accordingly. Be aware with though, that authorizers are need some cache tweaks to make it work. An additional requirement for my implementation was, that quotas are only increased on successful invokes of the mutation.</div>\n</div>\n\n<h1 id=\"heading-what-is-rate-limiting-and-why-implement-it\">What Is Rate Limiting and Why Implement It?</h1>\n<p>Rate limiting controls traffic to a network, app, or API. It does this by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a set time, like 100 requests per minute. It ensures efficient use of system resources. It also protects the infrastructure from misuse or overload.</p>\n<p>Why implement rate limiting?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rate limiting safeguards against malicious activities. These include Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, brute force login attempts, and excessive API scraping. It does this by capping the request frequency.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It prevents servers from becoming overwhelmed by limiting request volume. This ensures a consistent, reliable experience for all users.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In shared environments, rate limiting ensures fair access to resources. It prevents certain users from monopolizing bandwidth or server capacity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Limiting traffic cuts costs by reducing server load. This is key for APIs that do resource-heavy tasks. It ensures they are used wisely.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rate limiting can help monetize. For example, you can offer a free tier with a limit on requests. This will attract new users. Charge for any extra usage for resource-intensive APIs. These include those for complex data processing, machine learning, or real-time analytics. Heavy usage incurs high costs. Higher-tier plans can include elevated rate limits, providing premium access and encouraging upgrades.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For usage-based or subscription-based APIs, rate limiting ensures users stay within their plans. It helps avoid unexpected costs and encourages users to scale up their usage.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rate limiting can act as a gateway to premium services. It offers a baseline of free requests. This lets users test an API's value before committing to higher prices.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-implementing-the-middleware\"><strong>Implementing the Middleware</strong></h1>\n<p>In this post we explore an option to rate limit users based on their available quota. This information can come from some hard limit or be based on the current subscription of a user within our product.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s get started with the implementation. First, we only want to rate limit some operations of our API. So we can define them for later use.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-typescript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> QUOTA_OPERATION = [\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">'generate'</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">'analyze'</span>\n] <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">as</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">type</span> QuotaOperation = (<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">typeof</span> QUOTA_OPERATION)[<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">number</span>];\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a first step, w define what rate limits a user can have based on the operation and entitlement. Let’s assume there are<code>free</code>, <code>advanced</code> and <code>enterprise</code>. We can use a simple mapping between an entitlement a user can have within our app and the resulting amount of request they can make. Additionally, we want to save when these rate limits are resting (e.g. seconds, minutes, days or even weeks).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-typescript\">\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> QUOTA_PERIOD = [\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">'second'</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">'minute'</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">'hour'</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">'day'</span>\n] <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">as</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">type</span> QuotaEntitlements =\n  | <span class=\"hljs-string\">'free'</span>\n  | <span class=\"hljs-string\">'advanced'</span>\n  | <span class=\"hljs-string\">'enterprise'</span>;\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> RATE_LIMITING_QUOTAS: Record&lt;\n  QuotaEntitlements,\n  Record&lt;\n    QuotaOperation,\n    {\n      limit: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">number</span>;\n      period: QuotaPeriod;\n    }\n  &gt;\n&gt; = {\n  free: {\n    analyze: {\n      limit: <span class=\"hljs-number\">100</span>,\n      period: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'day'</span>\n    },\n    generate: {\n      limit: <span class=\"hljs-number\">10</span>,\n      period: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'minute'</span>\n    }\n  },\n  advanced: {\n     analyze: {\n      limit: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1000</span>,\n      period: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'day'</span>\n    },\n    generate: {\n      limit: <span class=\"hljs-number\">100</span>,\n      period: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'minute'</span>\n    }\n  },\n  enterprise: {\n     analyze: {\n      limit: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1000</span>,\n      period: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'hour'</span>\n    },\n    generate: {\n      limit: <span class=\"hljs-number\">100</span>,\n      period: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'second'</span>\n    }\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following is defined from the above code:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Every user on the free plan can call <code>analyze</code> <em>100</em> times a day and <code>generate</code> <em>10</em> time per minute</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Every user on the advanced plan can call <code>analyze</code> 1000 times a day and <code>generate</code> 100 time per minute</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Every user on the enterprise plan can call <code>analyze</code> 1000 times an <strong>hour</strong> and <code>generate</code> 100 time per <strong>second</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In our case, that means it is important what the <strong>highest</strong> entitlement of the user is.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-typescript\">\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> ENTITLEMENT_ORDER: Record&lt;QuotaEntitlement, <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">number</span>&gt; = {\n  free: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>,\n  advanced: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n  enterprise: <span class=\"hljs-number\">3</span>\n} <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">as</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> getHighestEntitlement = (entitlements: QuotaEntitlement[]): <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-params\">QuotaEntitlement</span> =&gt;</span> {\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> entitlements.reduce(\n    <span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">highest, current</span>) =&gt;</span>\n      ENTITLEMENT_ORDER[current] &gt; ENTITLEMENT_ORDER[highest]\n        ? current\n        : highest,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">'free'</span>\n  );\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>We need to store everything in a format so that we know, for which rate limit we need to check, what the current used quota is and when the quota will reset itself.

It allows us to limit any execution of the operations we have defined in the timeframes we have defined. Also, this is not on a best-effort basis. It will block any request that exceeds the pre-defined limit.</p>\n<p>We can enhance our implementation in many ways. We can make it more dynamic by storing more information. If we change our quotas in the future, existing accounts would not be affected. We can make the entitlements and operation mapping more modular. This would help apps with dynamic, not strict, plans and entitlements. Or, and this is a big decision, use a different storage engine. It can have benefits.</p>\n<p>Choosing the correct storage can be tough. The advantage of momento and other caches is that they use atomic writes (Redis does as well). This comes in handy, as it prevents race conditions from different requests. You may also want to check the concurrency settings on your lambda in regard to that.</p>\n<p>The decision should also depend on the throughput you are expecting for your API. Caches are fast and cheap, but have some other limitations. Databases can get expensive if you have many reads and writes to manage your API's rate limits. However, they offer other benefits.</p>\n<p>As in so many cases, it really depends on your use case and what you want to achieve.</p>\n<p>See you next time. 👋</p>\n","subtitle":"Rate limiting an API or service is a common use case.

While on maternity leave, I finally have time to deeply explore random technical problems without deadlines - a rare opportunity.</p>\n<p>Thus far, I've focused on contributing to an open source AI agent called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://block.github.io/goose\">codename goose</a> built with a Rust backend and Electron-based chat interface. I submitted a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/block/goose/pull/542\">pull request</a> to add a WYSIWYG editor to its chat interface, opting to build a custom solution instead of using existing packages. The maintainers appreciated this approach since editor dependencies bloat bundle size, but raised concerns about the toolbar consuming too much visual space. They suggested implementing a popover toolbar instead.</p>\n<p>I wrongly assumed creating a floating toolbar would be simple. I aimed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Show a popover toolbar when text is selected</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Position it precisely above the selection</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Handle word-wrapped text spanning multiple lines</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Maintain accurate positioning during scroll</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Handling popovers in a text area element turned out to be more complex than expected. In this blog post, I’ll share what I learned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-text-areas-arent-your-average-dom-elements\">Text areas aren’t your average DOM elements.</h2>\n<p>Unlike typical HTML elements where we can manipulate contents, measure positions, and add new elements, text areas only expose raw text content and basic selection APIs. Browsers control their rendering behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>I asked Claude to generate an analogy for further illustration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Regular HTML elements</strong> are like having a house where you can move the furniture around, add new items, measure distances between things, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Text areas</strong> are more like looking through a window into a room you can't enter. You can see what's inside and make some basic changes (like adding/removing text), but you can't reach in and manipulate things directly. The browser handles all the internal workings using native OS text editing capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-popovers-outside-of-text-areas\">Popovers outside of text areas</h2>\n<h3 id=\"heading-the-popover-api\">The Popover API</h3>\n<p>All modern browsers include a built-in Popover API for creating popup elements. Here's an example:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrapper\"><div class=\"embed-loading\"><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div></div><a class=\"embed-card\" href=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/knpf7w\">https://codesandbox.io/embed/knpf7w</a></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"heading-limitations\">Limitations</h4>\n<p>While this API is cross-browser compatible and straightforward to implement, it comes with several limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>It only works with button elements since the required <code>popovertarget</code> attribute is only available on buttons</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You have to use CSS to position the popover relative to its target element</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>And, my biggest limitation is that it doesn’t work within text areas.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shout out to Mark Techson for introducing me to the Popover API via Una Kravets’ conference talk called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/-0qa-UqTh_Q?si=IiwhJiXJbi_u4n-n&amp;t=642\">Less Cruft, More Power: Leverage the Power of the Web Platform</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-the-selection-api\">The Selection API</h3>\n<p>I wanted my popover to appear wherever the user selected text. This required me to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Know the position of the selected text</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Listen for events that happened when text was selected and deselected</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I came across Colby Fayock’s blog post called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spacejelly.dev/posts/how-to-share-selected-text-in-react-with-the-selection-api\">How to Share Selected Text in React with the Selection API</a>. While Colby's focus was on text sharing functionality, his post introduced me to the Selection API - which could help me position my popover relative to selected text.</p>\n<p>The Selection API lives in <code>window.getSelection()</code>. When you call this method, it returns a Selection object that tells you about the text a user has selected on the page.</p>\n<h4 id=\"heading-getrangeat0\">getRangeAt(0)</h4>\n<p>From this Selection object, you can call <code>getRangeAt(0)</code> to find out exactly where the selection begins and ends. It gives you two numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>startOffset</code> - where the selection begins</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>endOffset</code> - where the selection ends</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a selection, each character has an index. For the text \"Hello, World! Welcome.\", the indexes look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrapper\"><div class=\"embed-loading\"><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div></div><a class=\"embed-card\" href=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/vj49mj\">https://codesandbox.io/embed/vj49mj</a></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you select the word \"World\", then <code>startOffset</code> is 7 (where \"W\" begins) and <code>endOffset</code> is 12 (right after \"d\").</p>\n<p><strong>Side note:</strong> I learned that the parameter 0 in getRangeAt(0) tells the browser which selection you want information about. When you select text, each selection gets stored at different indexes in an array. Most browsers only let you select one piece of text at a time, so you'll only have one item at index 0. But browsers like Firefox let you hold Ctrl to select multiple pieces of text. If you try to access indexes greater than 0 in browsers that don't support multiple selections, you'll get an error.</p>\n<h4 id=\"heading-getboundingclientrect\">getBoundingClientRect()</h4>\n<p><code>getRangeAt(0)</code> gives you access to <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code>.</p>\n<p><code>getBoundingClientRect()</code> returns a box of measurements around your selected text. It tells you the top, right, bottom, and left positions of this box, plus its width and height.</p>\n<p>With these measurements, I could place my popover right above any text the user selects, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrapper\"><div class=\"embed-loading\"><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div></div><a class=\"embed-card\" href=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/mhxtkr\">https://codesandbox.io/embed/mhxtkr</a></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While this approach worked for most HTML elements, text area elements provide limited access to the Selection API, so I needed an alternative approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-the-mirrored-div\">The Mirrored Div</h3>\n<p>Through rubber ducking with Claude, I learned about the mirrored div approach, a workaround for determining selection coordinates in a text area.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works: create an invisible div that overlays the text area, containing the exact same content and styling. When a user selects text, they're actually interacting with this invisible div rather than the text area underneath it. This gives you access to the full Selection API while maintaining what looks and feels like a standard text area to the user.</p>\n<p>I found validation for this technique in Jhey Thompkins' blog post \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://jh3y.medium.com/how-to-where-s-the-caret-getting-the-xy-position-of-the-caret-a24ba372990a\">HOW TO: Where's the text cursor?</a>\", which introduced me to the <code>getComputedStyle()</code> method.

This week, Sandworm Monitor has identified several high-risk vulnerabilities in a wide array of NPM packages. We will delve into some of the most pressing issues and provide insights into best practices for developers to mitigate these threats. </p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-unmasking-malicious-postinstall-scripts\">Unmasking Malicious Postinstall Scripts</h2>\n<p>One repeat offender in our vulnerability assessments is the misuse of postinstall scripts. These scripts are meant to perform setup tasks when a package is installed, but they can also be exploited to carry out harmful actions. </p>\n<p>Take the case of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sandworm.dev/npm/security-vulnerabilities/package/soroswap-utils\"><code>soroswap-utils</code></a>. The package's postinstall script can source environment variables from sensitive files, providing a backdoor for attackers to access private information or run malicious Node.js scripts. This vulnerability highlights the need for developers to closely scrutinize the postinstall logic within third-party packages. Consider disabling these scripts entirely—or reviewing and auditing them rigorously—before executing.</p>\n<p>Another notable example comes from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sandworm.dev/npm/security-vulnerabilities/package/sysaid-infra-analytics\"><code>sysaid-infra-analytics</code></a>, where the postinstall script scrapes sensitive system information and exfiltrates it to an external server. This kind of data breach can have widespread ramifications, from privacy violations to more targeted attacks based on harvested data. As a countermeasure, developers should evaluate the need for postinstall scripts, remove unnecessary external communications during setup, and employ strict network egress controls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-exposing-critical-system-files-and-user-data\">Exposing Critical System Files and User Data</h2>\n<p>Several packages were found using scripts that read and transmit system-critical files to remote servers. For instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sandworm.dev/npm/security-vulnerabilities/package/pages-e2e\"><code>pages-e2e</code></a> uses a preinstall script to send the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file to a remote location, which is an alarming security risk.  </p>\n<p>Sending such files without explicit user consent violates privacy and can lead to extensive damage, such as unauthorized access to user accounts. Developers must avoid granting their packages unnecessary access to system files and ensure any system interaction is essential, transparent, and secure. Moreover, it is crucial to conduct thorough code reviews and audits of any scripts that access system files.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-reverse-shells-and-arbitrary-code-execution\">Reverse Shells and Arbitrary Code Execution</h2>\n<p>Some packages showed the tendency to establish reverse shell connections, which is a grave security danger. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sandworm.dev/npm/security-vulnerabilities/package/overture2osmjs\"><code>overture2osmjs</code></a> package is one such example, where a reverse shell is spawned, allowing an attacker full control over the victim's machine. These kinds of scripts highlight the importance of ensuring package integrity and understanding the trustworthiness of package sources.</p>\n<p>The risk here can be curbed by validating shell scripts and ensuring that software is only fetched from legitimate and secure sources. Integrating a tool like Sandworm Audit into your development workflow can help track direct and transitive dependencies for potential vulnerabilities, assisting in better management and reconciliation of risk dependencies. Check it out here: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/sandworm-hq/sandworm-audit\">Sandworm Audit</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-protecting-against-code-execution-vulnerabilities\">Protecting Against Code Execution Vulnerabilities</h2>\n<p>Many packages have scripts that can execute arbitrary commands, either through shell constructs or by altering existing code bases. A significant example is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sandworm.dev/npm/security-vulnerabilities/package/requests-async\"><code>requests-async</code></a> package, which downloads remote PowerShell scripts, adjusts execution policies, and even sets scripts to run persistently at system startup. These actions create vectors for attackers to plant malware or establish enduring backdoors.</p>\n<p>To counter such threats, developers should avoid executing commands dynamically from external sources within scripts. If such behaviors are absolutely necessary, stringent validation and integrity checks should be enforced. Employ network-based security policies and scrutinize all code dependencies for unwanted command execution abilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-recommendations-for-developers\">Recommendations for Developers</h2>\n<p>In light of these vulnerabilities, it is vital for developers to incorporate robust security practices into their CI/CD pipelines as well as into their development lifecycle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Review and Audit:</strong> Regularly perform comprehensive security reviews of all code including third-party dependencies.</li>\n<li><strong>Limit Script Permissions:</strong> Utilize package.json scripting functionality judiciously, and limit post-installation scripts' permissions and capabilities whenever possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Sandworm Audit:</strong> Make use of Sandworm Audit to gain insights into vulnerabilities and stay updated with the latest security advisories.</li>\n<li><strong>Securely Manage Secrets:</strong> Avoid storing sensitive configuration directly within the codebase, and leverage secure vaults or environment variables for the safe management of credentials.</li>\n<li><strong>Implement Network Controls:</strong> Employ network egress filters and multi-factor authentication to protect against unauthorized data exfiltration and account compromise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By adopting these best practices, developers can significantly enhance the security posture of their JavaScript applications, keeping potential threats at bay, and ensuring user data remains protected.</p>\n<p>Stay safe and secure in your coding endeavors, and remember: constant vigilance is our first line of defense against the ever-evolving threat landscape. Happy coding!</p>\n","subtitle":"The Latest JavaScript Security Vulnerabilities in NPM Packages\nHello and welcome to another edition of our ongoing series on JavaScript security!

It is one of the compute services for FaaS on AWS. When you deploy your functions to the cloud, AWS Lambda service is responsible for the execution. Knowing how to write and deploy functions is but a small percentage of what is required to build scalable serverless applications on AWS; it is a critical part not the only part. It is important to get ideas that can help when developing serverless applications.</p>\n<p>This article contains some of the lessons learned in my 5 years of writing serverless applications that go beyond just knowing about AWS Lambda.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive right in!</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-use-diagrams-as-a-guide\">Use Diagrams as a Guide</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1735887029760/75225274-b26b-4991-a602-fbceb0b0c975.png\" alt /></p>\n<p>Diagrams have been a great tool for software engineers for a long time and it did not change with serverless development. I’ve worked with engineering teams that start working on large-scale systems without a simple diagram and what you hear is: “As you use the application you will get to know what it does and what happens when request ‘x’ is made”. Maybe because of some requirements or something I’m not aware of, there is no simple documentation of the system’s architecture. I have used diagrams in most of my large-scale architectures and they have been helpful. Some reasons for having a diagram as a guide include:</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-birds-eye-view-of-required-components\">Bird’s-eye view of required components</h3>\n<p>In developing micro-services, it’s safe to say that the unit of deployment is a service — a service is self-contained and has all the required functions it needs to carry out its operation. For serverless APIs, the unit of deployment is a function. Yes!, a function. However, in most, if not all cases, this function is not the only piece of your API. The function may need to read or write data from a data store, interact with data in an SQS queue or EventBridge, and many other components. The fact is there are a lot of moving parts that need to be effectively coordinated. With a diagram, you can see those parts and how they interact with each other to bring a feature to life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-similar-component-concern\">Similar component concern</h3>\n<p>The cloud offers similar products to achieving a result, of course with subtle differences and it is important to pick the right service given the right context to enable us to achieve our goal efficiently. After a system has been designed, with a diagram, you can quickly and easily depict if a service in use is the most efficient given the context of the requirement  — <em>you must however understand how each service operates in detail and avoid assumptions</em>. Sometimes, you may have designed your architecture based on some limited requirement or even on assumptions. It is also possible that some parts of the system were rushed to quickly come up with a POC - that is fine. Having your solution in a diagram helps you understand what changes need to be done and how they affect the overall architectural solution. Diagrams also help in cases where there’s a change to the requirement; it becomes easy to spot the service that should be replaced if needed and where.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-review-solutions-across-the-development-life-cycle\">Review solutions across the development life cycle</h3>\n<p>Software development is likened to the Civil Engineering discipline where in most cases, a building plan is drawn before actual construction begins. If this happens, then having a diagram allows you the opportunity to have your thoughts <em>on paper(on screen)</em> which effectively helps you review your solutions before implementation. There could be a better solution than what you originally documented. Let me also advocate that the software architecture diagram be seen as a “living document” in the sense that, it could change or be updated as the actual development progresses. This happens as you learn more about a domain or realise a better service for the job. Hence, you do not need a 100% complete diagram before you commence development. Having a visual representation of your solution, helps you make adjustments even faster as you implement your solution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-fast-development-experience\">Fast development experience</h3>\n<p>I have noticed I go faster if I have a diagram that I can refer to as I implement a solution. This can be likened to goal setting and working backwards to implement the goal. It gives a feeling of having done it before. When you know the requirements and have documented the necessary services required to fulfil them, it's only a matter of your knowledge of the implementation. You really can go faster with a prepared diagram versus having to plan, think and develop almost simultaneously. It is useful here to remember that your code is not the solution - it is only an implementation of a solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-understand-the-details-of-a-service\">Understand the details of a service</h2>\n<p>It is typical in software engineering to start with a “hello world” type example when trying to learn a technology. It is ok and I am not against it— it’s ok to get started with an example of how to use a service; it helps you quickly see requirements as well as simple outputs. However, to get the best and customise to your requirements, you will need more than a hello-world type experience. To become really good at using a service, you need to get practical with the service with as many use cases as you need to. Some of the ways to get started with a service include reviewing the documentation and reading an in-depth blog or an open-source repository with examples. However, please note that while those ways of learning are really good, they could focus on certain aspects of services, not the full capabilities. For example, it’s general knowledge that Single Table Design in DynamoDB is very good. However, may not be suitable for all types of operations. Articles, blog posts, etc. have a focus — to get you to see a few things. Aside from all these, a progressive hands-on on the service is by far the best way to get a very good understanding of how the service operates, including its limitations — this helps you decide when to pick ‘<em>service a’</em> over ‘<em>service b</em>’ when solving your requirements challenge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-adopt-eda-early-for-efficient-scaling-needs\">Adopt EDA Early - For Efficient Scaling needs</h2>\n<p>One of the frequently talked about features of Lambda is that; it scales according to the number of requests. This means that a new instance of your lambda function is created to handle requests as they come in especially if a previous instance is “<em>still busy”</em>. It is true that lambda scales. However, understanding its limitations is key to its efficient use and mitigation of unexpected behaviours.</p>\n<p>Lambda does not scale infinitely, it has certain limits relating to the region of deployment and the number of functions that can be executed per time. Lambda’s concurrency limit causes requests to be throttled when the limit is reached. Therefore, to build efficient systems with efficient scaling capabilities, you need to consider Event-Driven Architectures. It is very easy to postpone learning about EDAs in Serverless Architecture to a later time but I recommend that it is brought forward because it is very important and fundamental to your learning and understanding as a serverless developer and in developing efficient and scalable serverless architectures.</p>\n<p>Two very fundamental aspects of EDAs are Queues and EventBuses. Fundamental knowledge of Amazon SQS and Amazon EventBridge can help you build efficient and scalable solutions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-what-does-that-framework-do-you-may-need-to-isolate-its-orchestration\">What does that framework do? You may need to isolate it’s orchestration</h2>\n<p>Frameworks help develop serverless applications because they provide some level of abstraction and structure as to how the application is written coupled with the ease of deployment.</p>\n<p>Having developed several serverless applications using frameworks like AWS SAM and Serverless Framework, it is important to note that some aspects of the service or component are automated for the engineer. A good example is when AWS SAM or Serverless Framework automatically creates one of the critical components in the serverless API: the API Gateway.</p>\n<p>In creating a custom API Gateway resource, the following resources are needed: <code>RestApi</code>, <code>Resource</code>, <code>Stage</code>, <code>Method</code>, <code>Deployment</code> and if you are using a custom domain, you will need both a <code>BasePathMapping</code> and <code>DomainName</code> resource.</p>\n<p>In the SAM snippet below, just by specifying the <code>Api</code> type in the event source of the function, AWS SAM automatically creates those components for you - (talk about making your life easy) - and after deployment is done, you’re greeted with a nicely formatted API Gateway URL with which you can access your APIs. A similar orchestration happens with the Serverless Framework.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-yaml\">  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">CheckoutFunction:</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Type:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">AWS::Serverless::Function</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Properties:</span>\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Handler:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">src/Checkout/index.handler</span>\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Description:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">Performs</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">order</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">checkout</span>\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">MemorySize:</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">128</span>\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Events:</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Api:</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Type:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">Api</span>\n          <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Properties:</span>\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Path:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">/checkout</span>\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Method:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">POST</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is useful as necessary - however, there will be times when you will need to orchestrate an API Gateway - hence, will need to define custom resources as listed above. This means you will need to know how to build an API Gateway resource just like the framework does so that you can decompose, isolate and build up as necessary. The lesson here is defaults are good, however, custom resources will need more than defaults.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-get-comfortable-with-iac-infrastructure-as-code\">Get Comfortable with IaC - Infrastructure as Code</h2>\n<p>I’ve been involved in projects where some resources like custom domain names are created via the AWS console. You soon find out that as the project progresses, such resources created become a breaking point for a smooth CI/CD process because they have been manually created and it is possible to forget that such resources were created (this happens a lot with S3 buckets).</p>\n<p>IaC becomes critical when you work in a multi-account setup and you have to deploy services or environments across accounts in an efficient way - most times, offloaded to a CI/CD process - which is the best practice.</p>\n<p>It is possible to become overly focused on functions. However, Infrastructure as Code is critical to your success in developing serverless applications. This includes defining resources like Buckets, Queues, Event Bridges, and others using code that can be checked into source control and integrated with a CI/CD process for an efficient and fast integration and deployment loop. This ensures consistency across environments, as multi-accounts are becoming common. You need to get comfortable with IaC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>This article shares insight from my journey in developing Serverless Applications on AWS. It looks beyond Lambda functions as the focus of Serverless Applications and shares ideas that I can help an engineer become better at building serverless applications including using flow diagrams for architecture visualisation, understanding the limitations of Lambda and the need for event-drive architectures. It also talks about understanding cloud service detail to make the right judgement as to what service to incorporate in architecture, with a note on the usefulness of IaC.</p>\n<p>Some common tools used include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Diagramming</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Lucid Chart</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Draw.io</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ExcaliDraw</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>IaC/Frameworks</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Pulumi</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Terraform</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>AWS CDK</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>AWS SAM</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Serverless Framework</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope this is helpful.

Whether you're debugging code, learning a new framework, or optimizing a system, the key to continual growth lies in your habits.</p>\n<p>This weekend, I re-read one of my favourite books, James Clear's <em>Atomic Habits</em>, and was inspired to apply the principles of habit formation to become more effective developers and accelerate our learning process.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.\" - Robert Collier</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"heading-why-habits-matter-for-developers\">Why Habits Matter for Developers</h1>\n<p>In the fast-paced world of technology, developers face constant pressure to keep up with new languages, frameworks, tools, and best practices. But mastery doesn’t happen overnight. The most successful developers aren’t necessarily the most naturally talented; rather, they are the ones who build and maintain productive habits over time.</p>\n<p>Habits allow us to automate parts of our daily routines, freeing up mental bandwidth for more complex problems. By making small, incremental improvements each day, we can steadily progress and build a solid foundation of knowledge and expertise.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-the-four-laws-of-atomic-habits\">The Four Laws of Atomic Habits</h1>\n<p>In his book, James Clear outlines four key laws that govern habit formation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Make it Obvious</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Make it Attractive</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Make it Easy</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Make it Satisfying</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s break down how we can apply these laws to our growth as developers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-1-make-it-obvious-set-clear-specific-goals\">1. Make it Obvious: Set Clear, Specific Goals</h2>\n<p>As a developer, the first step to cultivating new habits is to make your goals clear and specific. Rather than saying, \"I’ll improve my coding skills,\" you can break it down into specific actions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Write one unit test per day.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Solve one coding challenge every morning.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Read one technical blog or tutorial daily.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more specific your habit, the easier it is to follow. Make these goals visible—perhaps with a checklist on your workspace or a calendar where you can mark off completed tasks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-2-make-it-attractive\">2. Make it Attractive</h2>\n<h3 id=\"heading-connect-habits-to-something-you-enjoy\">Connect Habits to Something You Enjoy</h3>\n<p>To keep your motivation high, tie your technical habits to something you find rewarding. For example, after completing a task such as finishing a tutorial or debugging a complex problem, reward yourself with a small break or something you enjoy, like watching a short episode of a favorite series.</p>\n<p>If coding feels like a grind, channel your passion into the projects you build. Choose themes or subjects that resonate with you personally. For example, I often create side projects related to Pokémon, my favorite childhood game. Whether it’s a Pokédex built with a custom trained ML model, or a strategy simulator coded to experiment with APIs, these projects allow me to connect learning with something I love. If you’d like to see an example of this approach, check out my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lo-victoria.com/victorias-edition-my-journey-into-tech\"><em>Victoria’s Edition: My Journey into Tech</em></a> article, where I shared how these personal projects fueled my growth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1660831885539/Jjwq9Yc5m.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp\" alt=\"image.png\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-turning-leetcode-questions-into-relatable-problem-solving-challenges\"><strong>Turning LeetCode Questions into Relatable Problem-Solving Challenges</strong></h3>\n<p>LeetCode and similar coding challenge platforms are great for sharpening your problem-solving skills, but they can sometimes feel dry or abstract. Make these exercises more enjoyable by reframing them into challenges you can relate to. Instead of just solving a binary tree traversal, imagine you're designing a feature for a real-world application you’re excited about.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Sorting algorithms</strong>: I would imagine I’m organizing Pokémon cards by rarity or type.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Graph problems</strong>: Picture yourself mapping out the shortest route to visit multiple cafes for cafe-hopping.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Dynamic programming</strong>: Think of ways to optimize a strategy in a favorite video game.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This mental reframing not only makes problem-solving more fun but also helps you retain concepts better by associating them with something meaningful to you. Over time, this approach can transform coding challenges into opportunities for creative expression.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-3-make-it-easy-start-small-and-build-gradually\">3. Make it Easy: Start Small and Build Gradually</h2>\n<p>Incorporating habits into your daily routine can seem overwhelming at first, especially if you're trying to learn a new programming language or framework. Instead of jumping into complex projects, start small. Set achievable goals that are easy to start with and build on them over time.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Instead of committing to write a full-feature application, begin with writing small functions.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Take on the 30DaysOfCode or 100DaysOfCode challenge to stay consistent and code a bit every day.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By starting small, you can avoid the burnout that comes from setting overly ambitious goals, making it easier to build momentum. If you want to learn more about burnout, read <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lo-victoria.com/why-burnouts-should-not-be-ignored\">Why Burnouts Should Not be Ignored</a> (shameless plug).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610337137584/wqaabJeJs.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp\" alt=\"Why Burnouts Should Not Be Ignored\" /></p>\n<p>💡 Tip: Write down your goals and break them into smaller milestones to work towards gradually. Have a clear set of daily actions that will bring you closer to those milestones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-4-make-it-satisfying-track-your-progress-and-celebrate-wins\">4. Make it Satisfying: Track Your Progress and Celebrate Wins</h2>\n<p>One of the most powerful aspects of habit formation is <strong>the sense of progress</strong>. When we feel we're making headway, we're more likely to continue. Use a habit tracker to monitor your progress or log the tasks you've completed, whether it's with a simple note-taking app, or one you create yourself.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1735916399233/061d4691-9200-4530-a55c-6ab7e08f0617.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>Celebrate when you hit milestones—this could be anything from completing a challenging project to mastering a new framework. For instance, after completing a month of daily coding challenges, treat yourself to a well-earned reward. These small wins reinforce the behavior and make it easier to keep going.</p>\n<p>💡 Tip: Have an accountability buddy so they can celebrate your wins with you!</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-good-habits-for-every-developer\">Good Habits for Every Developer</h1>\n<h2 id=\"heading-1-writing-clean-readable-code\">1. Writing Clean, Readable Code</h2>\n<p>Clean code isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s the backbone of maintainable and scalable software. Whether you’re working solo or as part of a team, readable code makes your work easier to understand, debug, and improve over time.</p>\n<p>We should aim to write meaningful variable and function names and follow best practices and coding standards. Refactoring, though often overlooked, is another key practice—regularly revisiting and refining your code can work wonders for its longevity and clarity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-2-communicating-and-collaborating-effectively\">2. Communicating and Collaborating Effectively</h2>\n<p>We should not only write readable code, but also build the habit of documenting it well. Strong communication and collaboration skills are never overrated. Writing clear documentation ensures your work remains accessible to anyone who encounters it. Engaging in code reviews and brainstorming sessions not only sharpens your skills but also fosters a culture of learning and collaboration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-3-staying-curious-and-always-learning\">3. Staying Curious and Always Learning</h2>\n<p>Technology doesn’t stand still, and neither should you. Continuous learning is a habit every developer should embrace. Explore new tools, frameworks, or programming languages that pique your interest. Keep asking questions, experimenting, and seeking new or creative solutions to problems.</p>\n<p>💡 Tip: Joining a community is one way to keep learning, share knowledge and seek feedback to soluions!</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-4-prioritizing-your-health\">4. Prioritizing Your Health</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most overlooked habit in our field is maintaining good health. Hours of screen time, poor posture, and long periods of inactivity can lead to significant physical and mental strain. I’ve had my share of health challenges—eye abrasions, sprained shoulders, the occasional static electricity shock, and persistent eye bags, to name a few. Honestly, you might feel invincible in your 20s, but these experiences have taught me that neglecting your health will eventually catch up with you.</p>\n<p>To counter the poor default working conditions, I invested in an ergonomic chair, <s>maintain good posture</s>, <s>cut the caffeine</s>, grow plants to keep my room well-lit and set boundaries between work and personal life. I’m still very much working on it, but these are simple yet effective ways to sustain your (and probably my) well-being. Remember to also take frequent breaks to stretch and drink water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-5-reflecting-on-your-journey\">5. Reflecting on Your Journey</h2>\n<p>Being a good developer isn’t measured by the number of lines of code you write. It’s about learning, growing, and appreciating the path you’ve taken. Reflection is a powerful habit that allows you to recognize your achievements and identify areas for improvement.</p>\n<p>Some developers maintain daily or weekly journals to log their experiences and lessons. Personally, I prefer doing a yearly review—a detailed reflection that encapsulates my thoughts, challenges, and milestones. My <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lo-victoria.com/2024-year-in-review\">2024 Year in Review</a> is an example of this process. Throughout the year, I jot down notes about what I learn or even random thoughts, and by the year’s end, I organize them into a cohesive narrative. It’s my way of looking back, thanking those who’ve supported me, and planning for what’s next. Whether you journal regularly or take a more periodic approach, the key is to find a rhythm that works for you.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>As a developer, building strong habits isn’t just about staying productive—it’s about fostering a growth mindset that helps you adapt, learn, and thrive in a fast-changing field. By applying the principles of <em>Atomic Habits</em>, you can break down complex goals into achievable steps, make learning more enjoyable, and track your progress effectively. Over time, these small changes will lead to remarkable improvements in your coding abilities, your workflow, and your career.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading! I hope you have found this article helpful!

Imagine querying a database table and missing a few rows of data—that would be catastrophic. Yet, we make database calls without concern about missing data, thanks to TCP's integrity guarantees. In networking, balancing data integrity with latency is a challenge, especially given the unpredictable nature of the internet. We never know how many routers our network calls hop through, and despite many routers or switches potentially dropping packets, data loss is not an issue.</p>\n<p>In the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://oxyprogrammer.com/navigating-networking-layers-the-journey-of-data-through-tcp\">first article</a> of this networking series, we briefly discussed TCP connections, examining how the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://oxyprogrammer.com/navigating-networking-layers-the-journey-of-data-through-tcp#heading-os-facilitating-tcp-connection-under-the-hood\">OS handles them internally</a>.

TCP is methodical about initiating, maintaining, and terminating data transmission. A crucial aspect is the TCP connection.</p>\n<p>A TCP connection is bidirectional, enabling protocols like HTTP and WebSocket to operate effectively. It is initiated by the client and accepted by the server. A client is typically an application used directly by the user to initiate operations, while a server is a continuously available application that handles client requests.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it's more practical for clients to identify the server rather than vice versa, aligning with software architecture, not any inherent TCP directionality.</p>\n<p>TCP, a Layer 4 protocol with port visibility (see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://oxyprogrammer.com/navigating-networking-layers-the-journey-of-data-through-tcp\">first article</a>), requires an established connection for data transmission. A TCP connection resembles an agreement between a client and server, identified by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Client IP</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Client Port</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Destination IP</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Destination Port</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Establishing a TCP connection involves a three-way handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://oxyprogrammer.com/navigating-networking-layers-the-journey-of-data-through-tcp#heading-traveling-through-the-layers-of-network\">TCP segments</a> are sequenced and acknowledged. A delay in segment acknowledgment triggers a retransmission, which we will explore shortly.</p>\n<p>Multiple connections can exist between the same client and server, with TCP segments multiplexed into a single stream. This stream is then demultiplexed and routed to the appropriate programs listening on relevant ports.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-connection-establishing\">Connection Establishing</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1735036838686/a608f912-0c32-4fcd-96a6-65310e0399cf.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-tcp-connection-establishment-consists-of-three-way-handshake\">TCP connection establishment consists of three way handshake:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The sender sends a SYN request.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The receiver responds with a SYN/ACK message.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The initiator sends back an ACK message, finalizing the connection.

Sending too many segments could overwhelm the receiver's buffer, leading to dropped segments.</p>\n<p>This is where the Window Size field (refer to TCP segment anatomy) comes into play. Each acknowledgment from the receiver includes the current Window Size, informing the sender of how many packets can be sent.</p>\n<div data-node-type=\"callout\">\n<div data-node-type=\"callout-emoji\">💡</div>\n<div data-node-type=\"callout-text\">While the Window Size is significant, there are other factors influencing flow control that we will discuss in upcoming sections.</div>\n</div>\n\n<h1 id=\"heading-receiver-sliding-window\">Receiver (Sliding) Window</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeVIDjPEXTIxwPQ0QyFJ2d5mep2VLdN5nR-1BvXFN-xZj85A_k5Io_U1EKzYdUBh0H04PpJ1CHJbOVtVdcH8J8oMOD7Q26z8IjniPNjWEERsCgg4KSEOFxQZ2i29dzqmq5SbHVDNg?key=allS53MX6v5H-VzZb3VLXJ-m\" alt /></p>\n<p>The sliding window is a critical mechanism in TCP used by the sender.

The Size of the window gets set with every acknowledgement that comes back (remember the Window Size field in the TCP header?).</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-congestion-control\">Congestion Control</h1>\n<p>The flow of data from sender to receiver in TCP is not solely managed by flow control. Although flow control ensures that the receiver is not overwhelmed, the data must traverse several intermediary devices such as routers and switches. These network elements might not support rapid data flow even if the receiver can handle it. Therefore, TCP also incorporates congestion control to manage data transmission effectively.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Receiver Window (RWND), TCP utilizes a Congestion Window (CWND), which plays a crucial role in congestion control. It’s important to note that the CWND can never exceed the RWND.</p>\n<p>There are two primary algorithms for determining the size of the CWND:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>TCP Slow Start</strong>: This algorithm gradually increases the CWND size to identify the network's capacity without causing congestion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Congestion Avoidance</strong>: This algorithm aims to optimize data flow by adjusting the CWND size to avoid congestion once the initial network capacity has been identified.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's explore each of these algorithms in detail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-tcp-slow-start\">TCP Slow Start</h2>\n<p>Ironically, despite its name, TCP Slow Start is actually the fastest among the congestion control algorithms.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe-_OUVd-jkJbTKjQ5uBNy6vhd3BE6Na9_UcRZMBgE4I_vGNDVhmjSrX8vys2DB-kmo_-eqSNd_eGk_DypXxJPtpFSdlbcLXSc3C5r_dFY86HNFrXVp8QfyKHLaAOboRHCEcd7u?key=allS53MX6v5H-VzZb3VLXJ-m\" alt /></p>\n<p>In the example illustrated above:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Congestion Window (CWND) begins with a capacity of 1 segment. Accordingly, only one segment is sent initially.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Upon receiving acknowledgment from the receiver, the CWND is increased by 1.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The sender then transmits two segments: Segments 2 and 3.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In response, the receiver sends back acknowledgments for both segments (2 and 3). As a result, the CWND increases by 2 (1 for each acknowledgment received).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>With the CWND now allowing for larger transmission, the sender proceeds to send Segments 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"heading-congestion-avoidance\">Congestion Avoidance</h2>\n<p>Congestion Avoidance algorithm also increases the CWND but at a slower rate than TCP Slow start.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc6IhmnSLsQeVlDxg7BWg7OpPv78JiW6Fqf0N8q2oKnKL3rvM4mkQ527m9xD-TpcDpD_Qd2KacK_FvSo3eMHi9X8aIk_Pz8-Wd9h_q7LM8L505TWJvCJFdNSvNLD935UMX3vdofiw?key=allS53MX6v5H-VzZb3VLXJ-m\" alt /></p>\n<p>In the above diagram example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Congestion Window (CWND) begins with the capacity for 1 segment, so only one segment is initially sent.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Upon receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver, the CWND is increased by 1.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The sender then transmits two segments: Segments 2 and 3.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The receiver sends back acknowledgments for both segments. The CWND is increased by 1 for this entire round trip, as it pertains to the single window of data sent.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>With the updated CWND, the sender now sends Segments 4, 5, and 6.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"heading-congestion-notification\">Congestion Notification</h1>\n<p>Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model, providing them visibility into IP packets. IP packets include a field known as ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification). When routers detect their buffers are becoming full, they mark the ECN field in the IP packets and forward them to the receiver. Upon receiving these packets, the receiver notes the ECN marking in the IP headers and communicates this information back to the sender. The sender will  reduce the transmission rate to alleviate congestion.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-nagles-algorithm\">Nagle’s Algorithm</h1>\n<p>Nagle’s algorithm specifies that if there are in-flight segments—meaning segments that have been sent but for which an acknowledgment (ACK) has not yet been received—an IP packet will only be transmitted if it is completely filled. Conversely, if there are no in-flight segments, a packet will be sent even if it is only partially filled.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfI9AzDg889hvsguUc6GZ4IUR61iuXovpIY72OK3626xxLKMk-zYR4p0ip1PE3UgzxwnDhN-M5GrImcteUb3pOuL04KxwC9JGc5U_oysNb-50D6upIJPyzGOrW1rQXUs9OnH4QrLw?key=allS53MX6v5H-VzZb3VLXJ-m\" alt /></p>\n<p>In the diagram example provided:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Three completely filled IP packets are sent, while a partially filled packet is held back.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Once the acknowledgments for the three packets are received, the partially filled packet is then transmitted.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nagle’s algorithm is often disabled in modern networking practices because it can introduce additional latency.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-delayed-acknowledgement-algorithm\">Delayed Acknowledgement Algorithm</h1>\n<p>The Delayed Acknowledgment Algorithm is implemented on the receiver's side. This algorithm suggests that the receiver should wait to receive multiple packets before sending an acknowledgment (ACK). By doing so, the number of acknowledgments sent is reduced, which can help decrease overall latency in the communication process.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfiuNi68X7lZ0thL7iEl3e_-A1CmM9egQMJYG-yOLegRBxk_u-8buxG4DQLSnKTLvJMeXbUfCEah0GF2QvAybSFXC3LCfOyPKrBBA6e39xZ_Qxthvi25MXrEtYoTK5Po2L-palL?key=allS53MX6v5H-VzZb3VLXJ-m\" alt /></p>\n<p>A problem arises when both Nagle’s algorithm and the Delayed Acknowledgment Algorithm are used simultaneously. Nagle’s algorithm, which operates on the sender's side, holds back a packet until an acknowledgment (ACK) for previously sent segments is received. Meanwhile, the Delayed Acknowledgment Algorithm, implemented on the receiver's side, waits to receive multiple segments before sending back an ACK.</p>\n<p>This combination can create a deadlock-like situation, where the sender is waiting for an ACK that is not being sent because the receiver is holding off until it receives additional segments. As a result, this can lead to retransmissions and timeouts, negatively impacting network performance.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-tcp-head-of-line-blocking\">TCP Head of Line blocking</h1>\n<p>TCP ensures that segments are delivered in the order they are sent. Line of Head Blocking occurs when a segment in the middle of a sequence gets dropped, which particularly impacts HTTP requests because they often use the same connection to send multiple requests.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXduJXUlbZFCSo1pqqh4UhPzzjo2LFZEEQMhDdec4bVeT3hxDY2fuQoK-vL8xi42lHnRTCsQSbTFxxrPCqMg_A48rS05ECE3gmgAdsKoMdCyHM1M3ckMhKksKendaRIeEkuYrI_soA?key=allS53MX6v5H-VzZb3VLXJ-m\" alt /></p>\n<p>Consider the diagram example illustrated above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Request 1 is divided into Segments 1 and 2.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Request 2 is divided into Segments 3 and 4.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Segments 2, 3, and 4 are successfully transmitted but Segment 1 is dropped, the server will not send acknowledgments (ACKs) for Segments 2, 3, and 4 until Segment 1 is retransmitted.</p>\n<p>As a result, Request 2 suffers delays even though it was fully transmitted, because it is dependent on the status of Request 1.</p>\n<p>This scenario exemplifies Line of Head Blocking, where the processing of one request is held up due to the loss of an earlier packet.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>In this comprehensive article, we built upon the foundation established in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://oxyprogrammer.com/navigating-networking-layers-the-journey-of-data-through-tcp\">previous piece</a> and delved into the internals of TCP communication.

Among these advancements, <strong>AI Agents</strong> are rapidly becoming a critical tool for businesses and individuals alike.</p>\n<p>But what exactly are AI Agents, and why should you care about them?</p>\n<p>Let’s break it down, using practical examples to illustrate their power and potential.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-example\">Example</h1>\n<p>Let’s say I login to ChatGPT and ask: <em>How many vacation days does Victoria have left in 2025?</em></p>\n<p>ChatGPT would definitely give me the wrong answer.</p>\n<p>One of the significant limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) like the ones used by ChatGPT is their inability to answer highly specific questions if they haven't been explicitly trained on that information. Since ChatGPT has no access to my employee database, it does not have the accurate answer to my question.</p>\n<p>This is where <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> comes into play.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-how-rag-works\">How RAG Works:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Chunking Data</strong>: Start with a document or dataset, like a PDF containing Victoria’s vacation days. The document is broken into chunks of text small enough to fit into the LLM’s memory, which can handle up to 100,000 tokens.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Embedding Creation</strong>: These chunks are converted into embeddings—vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of the text.<br /> <em>(This topic can go deeper into transformer models which is outside this article’s scope.)</em></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Vector Search</strong>: When you pose a question like, “How many days off did Victoria take in 2024?” the system performs a vector search from the vector database. If any chunk in the document contains relevant information (e.g., “days off” or “2024”), it finds the exact match.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Answer Generation</strong>: The relevant chunk is fed back into the LLM, which then generates a precise, context-aware answers.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736569985320/7a8318a0-0563-41fa-8ef8-13bb9818ebf4.jpeg\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>So what does this all means? It means that RAG enables LLMs to answer questions with increased accuracy by accessing <strong>external, domain-specific</strong> knowledge. Businesses have developed RAG applications for practical uses, such as a chatbot that can answer customer or product-specific questions. In 2023, RAG has dominated and enhanced the usability and scalability of LLM-powered applications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-what-if\">What if?</h2>\n<p>But now, what if I ask: Based on the number of vacation days Victoria has left in 2025, suggest an itinerary for a Europe trip.</p>\n<p>In this case, I would need my chat application to be capable of searching not only my vacation days data, but also perform web search to provide a reasonable itinerary for an X-day Europe trip.</p>\n<p>One of the fallbacks of the naive RAG system is that it only retrieves information from a specific knowledge source that we already define for it (i.e. Victoria’s vacation days data). This means that it does not have the <strong>agency</strong> to decide which knowledge source to get its information from, making it a challenge when designing a solution for complex use cases.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-ai-agents-as-reasoning-planners\">AI Agents as Reasoning Planners</h1>\n<p>Recognizing this challenge, more businesses began to adopt agentic frameworks in 2024. An agentic RAG implements AI agents into the workflow, which can go beyond answering questions. AI agents act as <strong>reasoning planners</strong>, capable of orchestrating multiple downstream tasks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLDR: AI agents are powered by LLMs to execute end-to-end tasks autonomously and make decisions in real time to achieve their given objectives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The pillars that make up an AI agent are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>LLM (with a role and a task like a vacation days planner, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Memory (access to chat history, previous responses, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Planning (downstream tasks like routing, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Access to external tools to perform actions (web search, calendars, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ReAct</strong> (not the front-end one) agent model, which stands for \"Reasoning &amp; Acting,\" is a framework that combines both reasoning and action in AI agents. These agents are not limited to providing answers based on pre-programmed knowledge; instead, they can strategically plan and execute complex sequences of tasks to achieve specific objectives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736571287662/08bcdf88-08e4-417f-97a3-39aa6c566352.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>For example, here are some practical applications for AI Agents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Contract Negotiation</strong>: Imagine an AI agent designed to negotiate leases with landlords. The agent can analyze terms, suggest counteroffers, and even simulate negotiations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Personal Virtual Assistants</strong>: Tools like Google’s Bard demonstrate the potential for AI agents to act as comprehensive personal assistants, handling tasks like scheduling meetings, generating summaries, or organizing events.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the possibilities are endless! There are infinite ways to design agent-powered solutions, from simple single-agent to multi-agent solutions, from simple automation of daily tasks to complex task management. Let’s go back to our RAG example and learn how an Agentic RAG works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-how-agentic-rag-works-very-simplified\">How Agentic RAG Works (very simplified):</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Goal Identification</strong>: The user defines a task, like creating a travel itinerary or automating a business process.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Task Decomposition</strong>: The AI agent uses reasoning to break the goal into smaller tasks. Decide which knowledge source to retrieve the necessary information from.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Execution</strong>: Tasks are executed through a combination of LLM calls (to generate the content) and API calls (e.g. fetching weather data, searching popular itineraries, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The AI agent then decides whether the retrieved information is relevant and can choose to re-retrieve from other sources if needed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736736274712/9064a6cb-0429-49c4-8379-9c4bbf1505c7.jpeg\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-why-you-should-care\">Why You Should Care?</h1>\n<p>According to LangChain’s State of AI Agents report, about 78% of businesses are planning to implement AI agents in 2024.

Here are 3 most popular options:</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-1-langgraph\">1. <strong>LangGraph</strong></h2>\n<p>Probably the most popular framework for developing complex agentic workflows. It’s known to be highly customizable, and simplifies the creation of AI agents by providing tools for memory, chaining, and integration with APIs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Will publish a step-by-step tutorial on this so stay tuned!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"heading-2-openai-swarm\">2. <strong>OpenAI Swarm</strong></h2>\n<p>Developed by OpenAI, Swarm can be used to create reasoning agents that can handle text-based tasks. It’s known to be lightweight, “educational” and used to create smaller agents that are highly controllable and testable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m still experimenting with this but also hope to build a demo to compare with LangGraph.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"heading-3-crewai\">3) CrewAI</h2>\n<p>It’s one of the newer frameworks that is growing in popularity. It is simple to use because you can create agents with prompts, great for collaboration and developing multi-agent systems. However, it is known to be less versatile than LangGraph in terms of making highly complex workflows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-4-postman-ai-agent-builder\">4) Postman AI Agent Builder</h2>\n<p>This news was just out at the time of writing this article, Postman just launched its AI Agent Builder tool to help with making AI Agents easier, faster and more reliable!

Today, I'm excited to share a component from a project I've been working on that completely inverts the traditional scrolling paradigm rendering the view at the bottom of the HTML element rather than the top.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-the-bottom-up-approach-to-ui\">The Bottom Up Approach to UI</h2>\n<p>Most web experiences start at the top and scroll down, it's how we've trained users for decades. But what if we flipped this expectation on its head? That's exactly what this component does, effectively implementing a form of scroll jacking. Scroll jacking is a technique where developers override the browser's default scrolling behavior to create custom experiences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-my-inspiration-the-space-elevator\">My Inspiration: The Space Elevator</h2>\n<p>Before diving into the code, let's look at a brilliant example of this technique in action: Neal Agarwal's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://neal.fun/space-elevator/\">Space Elevator</a> interactive experience. This web app takes users on a journey from Earth deep into space, using scroll jacking in a way that makes perfect sense for the content.</p>\n<p>As you \"scroll up\" from Earth's surface, you ascend into the atmosphere, then space, passing satellites, the ISS, and eventually traveling beyond our solar system. The bottom-up approach here creates an intuitive mental model that aligns with the physical concept of ascending upward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-advantages-of-scroll-jacking\">Advantages of Scroll Jacking</h2>\n<p>This inverted scrolling paradigm offers several interesting benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Novel user experience</strong>: It immediately signals to users that they're interacting with something different and memorable.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Metaphorical alignment</strong>: For certain content types (like the space elevator example), it creates a more intuitive mental model.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Contrasting information hierarchy</strong>: It can emphasize importance by inverting the traditional importance cascade.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Engagement boost</strong>: The unexpected interaction pattern can increase curiosity and time-on-page.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"heading-challenges-to-consider-when-inverting-ui\">Challenges to Consider When Inverting UI</h2>\n<p>Of course, this approach isn't without its challenges:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Breaking user expectations</strong>: Users expect to scroll down, not up. This means you'll need to provide clear visual cues to prompt the desired behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Learning curve</strong>: There's a cognitive adjustment required when users encounter your interface.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Accessibility concerns</strong>: Non-standard scrolling behaviors can create barriers for some users if not implemented thoughtfully.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mobile considerations</strong>: Touch scrolling patterns are deeply ingrained, so mobile implementation requires extra care.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The biggest hurdle is undoubtedly the need to prompt users to scroll up. This goes against decades of muscle memory and learned behavior. To overcome this, you can implement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Animated indicators (like a bouncing scroll wheel pointing upward)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Clear call-to-action text (\"Scroll up to continue\")</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Visual design that implies upward movement</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>An animation that demonstrates the intended interaction</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-building-the-react-component\">Building the React Component</h2>\n<p>Now, let's get technical. The space elevator is coded in Vue. Here's how I implemented the same component in React:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-plaintext\">\"use client\";\n\nimport React, { useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport styles from \"./ScrollToTop.module.css\";\n\nconst ScrollToTop: React.FC = () =&gt; {\n  const containerRef = useRef&lt;HTMLDivElement&gt;(null);\n\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const observer = new MutationObserver(() =&gt; {\n      if (containerRef.current?.offsetHeight) {\n        window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);\n        observer.disconnect();\n      }\n    });\n\n    observer.observe(document.body, {\n      childList: true,\n      subtree: true,\n    });\n\n    return () =&gt; observer.disconnect();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;div className={styles.contentWrapper} ref={containerRef}&gt;\n        &lt;div className={styles.sectionHeader}&gt;\n          &lt;h1&gt;Scroll Up&lt;/h1&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ScrollToTop;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"heading-breaking-down-the-code\">Breaking Down the Code</h3>\n<p>Let's dissect how this component works:</p>\n<h4 id=\"heading-1-the-use-client-directive\">1. The \"use client\" Directive</h4>\n<p>The component starts with <code>\"use client\"</code> at the top, which is crucial when working with React Server Components. This directive explicitly tells React that this module and its dependencies should be executed on the client-side (browser) rather than the server. This is necessary because we need to access browser-specific APIs like <code>window</code> and DOM manipulation functions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"heading-2-component-setup-and-references\">2. Component Setup and References</h4>\n<p>We import the necessary React hooks: <code>useEffect</code> for handling side effects and <code>useRef</code> for creating a reference to our DOM element. The <code>containerRef</code> will be attached to the main content wrapper div, allowing us to monitor when it has been fully rendered.</p>\n<h4 id=\"heading-3-the-mutationobserver-magic\">3. The MutationObserver Magic</h4>\n<p>The real magic happens in the <code>useEffect</code> hook, where we use a <code>MutationObserver</code> to watch for changes to the DOM:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-plaintext\">useEffect(() =&gt; {\n  const observer = new MutationObserver(() =&gt; {\n    if (containerRef.current?.offsetHeight) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);\n      observer.disconnect();\n    }\n  });\n\n  observer.observe(document.body, {\n    childList: true,\n    subtree: true,\n  });\n\n  return () =&gt; observer.disconnect();\n}, []);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Creates a <code>MutationObserver</code> that watches for changes to the DOM</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When it detects that our referenced container has content with height (meaning it's been rendered), it scrolls the page to the bottom</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It then disconnects the observer since its job is complete</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The return function ensures proper cleanup by disconnecting the observer when the component unmounts</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"heading-4-the-component-structure\">4. The Component Structure</h4>\n<p>The component renders a simple structure with visual cues to prompt users to scroll up:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-plaintext\">return (\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div className={styles.contentWrapper} ref={containerRef}&gt;\n      &lt;div className={styles.sectionHeader}&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;Scroll Up&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The key here is connecting our <code>containerRef</code> to the content wrapper div via the <code>ref</code> attribute, which allows our code in <code>useEffect</code> to check when this element has been fully rendered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-making-it-accessible\">Making It Accessible</h2>\n<p>Accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought. Here's how to ensure your inverted scrolling component remains accessible:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Provide keyboard navigation alternatives</strong>: Ensure users can navigate through your content using keyboard commands, not just scrolling.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Use appropriate ARIA attributes</strong>: Add <code>aria-label</code> and other relevant attributes to explain the non-standard navigation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Respect user preferences</strong>: Check for <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media queries and provide alternatives for users who may experience motion sickness.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Clear instructions</strong>: Make sure instructions for navigating your UI are clear and available in multiple formats (visual, text, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Test with screen readers</strong>: Verify that screen reader users can understand and navigate your content coherently.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"heading-when-to-use-this-approach\">When to Use This Approach</h2>\n<p>This inverted scrolling pattern isn't appropriate for every project. Consider using it when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The content naturally follows a bottom-up metaphor (like the Space Elevator example)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You're creating an artistic or experimental interface where novelty is expected</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The user journey benefits from a reversed information hierarchy</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You can provide clear navigational cues to guide users</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Avoid this approach for content heavy websites, task oriented interfaces, or any context where efficient information retrieval is the primary goal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Playing with scroll direction is more than just a novelty, it's about finding new ways to map interface interactions to mental models that make sense for specific content. When implemented thoughtfully with clear user guidance and attention to accessibility, inverting the scroll direction can create memorable, engaging experiences.</p>\n<p>The React component shared demonstrates how to implement this technique efficiently, using modern React patterns like hooks, refs, and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver\">MutationObserver API</a>. It waits until content is fully rendered before triggering the scroll action and properly cleans up resources when finished.</p>\n","subtitle":"As software engineers, we're constantly looking for ways to create unique and memorable user experiences.

The bank isn’t out of money—it just refuses to process your transaction. Now imagine this happening to <strong>thousands of people at the same time.</strong></p>\n<p>This is what a <strong>denial-of-service (DoS) attack</strong> looks like in the blockchain world. Instead of hacking the system, attackers <strong>exploit weaknesses in the code to block</strong> others from using a smart contract. The contract is still there, but it’s as good as useless for many users.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, a DoS attack is like <strong>blocking the only exit in a building—people</strong> are stuck inside, even though the door is right there.</p>\n<p>These attacks can freeze funds, disrupt entire projects, and cause massive losses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-how-can-withdrawals-be-blocked-in-smart-contracts\"><strong>How Can Withdrawals Be Blocked in Smart Contracts?</strong></h2>\n<p>Today, we will discuss how users can get stuck in smart contracts and the hidden danger of withdrawals.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself in a situation where the vending machine that gives out snacks was jammed by someone intentionally and the machine can no longer give anyone a snack, what would you do? That’s exactly what happens with <strong>withdrawal functions in smart contracts—they</strong> can be <strong>jammed</strong> or <strong>blocked</strong>, stopping people from getting their money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-why-are-withdrawal-functions-vulnerable\"><strong>Why are withdrawal functions vulnerable?</strong></h3>\n<p>Withdrawal functions in smart contracts are particularly vulnerable because they handle money being sent out of the contract.</p>\n<p>When a withdrawal happens, the contract needs to send funds to someone’s address. This means:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The contract must interact with external addresses (EOAs or other contracts)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The contract has to transfer actual value (cryptocurrency)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The receiving address might do unexpected things when it gets money</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, one broken withdrawal can block everyone. Some contracts process all withdrawals in a single transaction. If one person’s withdrawal <strong>fails</strong>, the entire transaction <strong>reverts</strong>, blocking everyone else. Attackers exploit this by <strong>deliberately making their withdrawal fail</strong>, locking up funds for everyone.</p>\n<p>There could also be gas limit problems. If a contract tries to send money to multiple people in a single transaction, the gas cost can become too high.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-the-problem-with-push-based-payments\"><strong>The Problem with Push-Based Payments</strong></h2>\n<p>Some smart contracts implement a “push” payment model where the contract directly sends funds to recipients. While this approach seems straightforward, it introduces a critical vulnerability: the contract’s ability to function becomes dependent on the recipient’s ability to receive funds.</p>\n<p>Let’s examine a real-world vulnerability found in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://solodit.cyfrin.io/issues/m-06-denial-of-service-contract-owner-could-block-users-from-withdrawing-their-strike-code4rena-putty-putty-contest-git?source=post_page-----bde2eb557231---------------------------------------\">Putty Finance protocol</a> and explain how the “withdrawal pattern” can prevent such issues.</p>\n<p>In Putty Finance’s case, when users withdrew their funds, the contract first attempted to send a fee to the contract owner before sending the remaining funds to the user:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-solidity\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">uint256</span> feeAmount <span class=\"hljs-operator\">=</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (fee <span class=\"hljs-operator\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>) {\n    feeAmount <span class=\"hljs-operator\">=</span> (order.strike <span class=\"hljs-operator\">*</span> fee) <span class=\"hljs-operator\">/</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">1000</span>;\n    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount);\n}\n\nERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">msg</span>.<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">sender</span>, order.strike <span class=\"hljs-operator\">-</span> feeAmount);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This design created two potential DoS scenarios:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>The Zero Address Problem</strong>: If the contract owner is set to the zero address (0x0), many ERC20 tokens will revert the transfer, causing the entire withdrawal function to fail. This will permanently lock users’ funds in the contract.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Malicious Token Hooks</strong>: ERC777 tokens or similar standards that implement receiver hooks could be used by a malicious contract owner to implement logic that rejects incoming transfers, making it impossible for users to withdraw their funds.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s see what the address zero and the ERC777 are.</p>\n<p>The <strong>zero address</strong> (<code>0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000</code>) is a special Ethereum address that no one controls. It is commonly used as a placeholder to indicate an uninitialized or non-existent address in smart contracts. Developers use it for various purposes, such as checking if an ownership variable has been set, burning tokens by sending them to an inaccessible location, or preventing accidental transfers. Since no private key exists for the zero address, any funds or tokens sent to it are permanently lost.</p>\n<p>ERC777 is an advanced Ethereum token standard that improves upon ERC20 by introducing a built-in <em>hook mechanism</em> that enables smart contracts and external accounts to react when they receive tokens. It maintains backward compatibility with ERC20, meaning it can work with existing ERC20 applications. A key feature is the <code>tokensReceived</code> hook, which allows recipients (especially smart contracts) to execute custom logic upon receiving tokens, enabling automation and security enhancements. ERC777 also supports <em>operator functionality</em>, allowing approved addresses to send tokens on behalf of others, improving usability for wallets and DeFi applications.</p>\n<p>Token hooks are callback functions that execute automatically when tokens are transferred. The most notable example is the ERC777 token standard, which introduced hooks as an improvement over the basic ERC20 standard.</p>\n<p>When an ERC777 token is transferred, it calls the <code>tokensReceived</code> hook on the recipient's address if the recipient is a contract. This happens before the transfer completes, allowing the recipient to react to incoming tokens.</p>\n<p>From the code above, if the <code>baseAsset</code> is an ERC777 token and the <code>owner()</code> is a contract, the owner could implement a malicious <code>tokensReceived</code> hook that deliberately reverts:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-solidity\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Malicious owner contract</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-class\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">contract</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">MaliciousOwner</span> </span>{\n    <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">tokensReceived</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">address</span> operator,\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">address</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span>,\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">address</span> to,\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">uint256</span> amount,\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">bytes</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">calldata</span> userData,\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">bytes</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">calldata</span> operatorData\n    </span>) <span class=\"hljs-title\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">external</span></span> </span>{\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Deliberately revert when receiving tokens</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">revert</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Denied\"</span>);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the owner fee transfer happens before the user receives their funds, this malicious reversion blocks ALL user withdrawals, effectively holding user funds hostage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-the-withdrawal-pattern-solution\"><strong>The Withdrawal Pattern Solution</strong></h2>\n<p>The “withdrawal pattern” is a best practice in smart contract design that separates the tracking of balances from the actual transfer of funds. It eliminates this vulnerability by separating the accounting from the transfer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-how-it-works\"><strong>How It Works</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Instead of immediately transferring funds to recipients, the contract tracks owed balances internally</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Recipients must explicitly call a separate function to withdraw their funds</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Each

developers. By separating balance tracking from fund transfers, it prevents numerous DoS attack vectors and ensures that users maintain control over their assets.</p>\n<p>As demonstrated in the Putty Finance example, even well-intentioned contract designs can contain vulnerabilities when they directly transfer funds to recipients during multi-step operations. By adopting the withdrawal pattern, you can build more resilient protocols that inspire user confidence and protect against potential DoS attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong> <em>design patterns matter in blockchain security. The withdrawal pattern isn’t just a coding preference—it’s an essential security measure for any contract that handles value transfers.</em></p>\n<p>Always stay safe out there. It does not matter if you are a developer or a user. You should always ask yourself this question: <strong>Is the withdrawal pattern followed to prevent denial of service?</strong></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this article.

Let me take you back a bit. You might know about our various internet phases: from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/web-20-web-30-5208698\">1995 to 2000 (Web1), 2000 to 2020 (Web2, which is still active), and now Web3</a> and Web5 up to the present.</p>\n<p>Yes, Web5. If this is your first time hearing about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/Vw3i2LeVa_Y?t=128\">Web5, you can learn about it with this breakdown from Adewale Abatti (Acekyd)</a>.</p>\n<p>It's fascinating to see how things have changed over time. But can you guess what the different eras have in common? Please take a moment to think about it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The tech skill!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, tech skills are transferable skills you can own, nurture, and improve without worrying about the next iteration of the internet or trends. Before I stray too far, let me bring you back to why you're reading this: it's about valuing depth over trends or, simply put, Depth over Trend. However, you prefer to call it.</p>\n<p>Let's talk about what's important, what you need, and why you need it. I will also share what I have learned from the past months of thinking about what truly matters, using the history I mentioned earlier. As you all know, data don’t lie.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-depth-vs-trend\">Depth vs Trend</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/28795077/pexels-photo-28795077/free-photo-of-abstract-green-spiral-design-on-black-background.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=1&amp;w=500\" alt=\"Free Artistic 3D spiral structure in green hues against a solid black background, showcasing modern abstract design. Stock Photo\" class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>To explain this concept the way I think about it, and how I believe everyone reading this should subconsciously think about it, is to use the idea of trade.</p>\n<p>\"Depth\" refers to the volume and liquidity at different <strong>price levels</strong> in the order book, while \"Trend\" refers to the overall direction of <strong>price movement over time.</strong> Think of it this way: trends are what everyone can see. They're the apparent upward or downward movements that catch attention. People chase trends because they're visible and exciting - like jumping on the AI bandwagon or whatever’s hot on Twitter this week.</p>\n<p>But depth? That's where the real value sits. It’s having deep knowledge or capability that persists regardless of market conditions. <strong>Trends come and go, but depth gives you staying power.</strong></p>\n<p>What makes them similar is that both can lead to success. You can make quick wins following trends like day traders can profit from momentum. But the difference is <strong>sustainability</strong>.</p>\n<p>Depth wins in the long run because it builds compounding value. While trend-chasers constantly restart with each new wave, depth-focused players build foundations that strengthen over time. When the trend inevitably shifts, those without depth get washed out, while those with substantive knowledge or skills remain valuable.</p>\n<p>As <em>Warren Buffett says - when the tide goes out, you discover who’s been swimming naked.</em> Depth is your protection when trends reverse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-why-should-you-care\">Why should you care?</h2>\n<p>Even if you think all that matters is money, who doesn't like money? Understanding the difference between depth and trends isn’t just academic. It directly impacts where you invest your limited <strong>time and energy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Chasing trends without depth is like buying into market momentum without understanding fundamentals. Sure, you might catch some upside, but you're essentially gambling. When the music stops, you're left without a chair.</p>\n<p>Trends often shine a lot, and if you aren't careful as a builder, founder, or developer, it's very easy to get carried away with them. But then, I know what you might be thinking: ” Everyone is doing it”, ” It’s the next big thing,” “I don’t want to miss out,” and all that. But in reality, there are different phases of life, the same as tech and the tech ecosystem in general.</p>\n<p>Depth, on the other hand, is <strong>compound interest</strong> for your career and business. Each layer of deep understanding builds on previous layers, creating compounding returns that trends can't can't.</p>\n<p>Take developers who studied fundamental programming concepts versus those who just learned the trending framework of the month. When React inevitably gives way to the next big thing, guess who adapts faster? The ones with depth.</p>\n<p>Or consider founders who deeply understand customer problems versus those chasing funding trends. When venture capital dried up in 2022-2023, companies with genuine market depth survived while trend-chasers ran out of runway.</p>\n<p>The market eventually rewards depth not because it's virtuous but because it's viable. And in an increasingly noisy world where everyone chases the same trends, depth is your unfair advantage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every person who created something different focused on depth, which often comes from a deep work state—a flow state of continuous, focused work. With trends, you stay at the top. It only requires shallow work to produce something of substance. - Blessing Adesiji</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What can you do differently?</p>\n<p>Stop treating tech like a fashion show. Take a breath instead of <strong>reflexively jumping on every new framework, language, or platform that trends on X(Formerly Twitter)</strong>.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself: \"Does it solve a fundamental problem, or is it just shiny?\"</p>\n<p>It doesn’t mean you should isolate yourself and not keep abreast of what's going on around you.</p>\n<p>Develop your Bulls***t detector. When everyone's hypineveryone's thing, that's your cue that's skeptical. The real opportunities often lie in areas others overlook because they're too busy following the crowd.</p>\n<p>Allocate your learning time like an investment portfolio:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>70% toward deepening your understanding of fundamentals that won't change.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>20% tailoring adjacent skills that complement your core.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>10% experimenting with trends.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Build relationships with people who prioritize depth. You become the average of the five people you spend the most time with, so surround yourself with depth-seekers who ask hard questions rather than trend-followers who chase easy answers.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, be willing to be temporarily uncool. The paradox is that ignoring what's trendy positions you to catch more immense, meaningful waves later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-self-reflection\">Self Reflection</h2>\n<p>Take a moment to audit your recent decisions. How many were made because \"everyone is doing it\" versus a ”deep understanding of underlying value”?</p>\n<p>Look at your skill set critically. If the tech landscape dramatically changed tomorrow, which of your abilities would remain valuable? Those are your depth areas.</p>\n<p>Consider your heroes in tech. Are they known for riding trends or creating fundamental value regardless of market conditions? What can you learn from their approaches?</p>\n<p>Ask yourself the uncomfortable question: \"<strong>Am I building something that will matter in five years?</strong>\" If not, you might be optimizing for trends over depth.</p>\n<p>Finally, depth isn't just technical knowledge; it's understanding people, problems, and principles. The most profound insights often come from connecting dots across disciplines rather than narrowing down to what's happening.</p>\n<p>The choice between depth and trend is not a career strategy. It's a philosophy about how you want to contribute to the world. Choose wisely.</p>\n<p>Olanetsoft ✍️</p>\n","subtitle":"This isn't a typical blog I write, but I'm going to share some raw thoughts along with rhetorical questions that you might find useful and helpful.\n\nIt's interesting to see how fast the ecosystem moves today, which has made me think a lot over the pa...","cover_image_url":"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/stock/unsplash/0YQOOxNT2V4/upload/3c26856be5dc97cd3e70b34461d92523.jpeg","cover_aspect_ratio":"16:9","author_id":"source-hashnode","author":{"id":"source-idris olubisi","email":"source-idris olubisi@inkboard.eu","username":"source-idris olubisi","display_name":"Idris Olubisi","avatar_url":"https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/initials/svg?seed=Idris%20Olubisi","role":"USER","is_verified":true,"is_suspended":false,"created_at":"2026-02-25T18:20:32.157Z","follower_count":0,"following_count":0,"total_likes":0,"post_count":0},"tags":[{"id":"Developer","name":"Developer","post_count":1},{"id":"Beginner Developers","name":"Beginner Developers","post_count":1},{"id":"Founder","name":"Founder","post_count":1},{"id":"software development","name":"software development","post_count":1}],"source_url":"https://blog.idrisolubisi.com/depth-over-trend","published_at":"2025-03-23T10:00:30.150Z","created_at":"2025-03-23T10:00:30.150Z","read_time_minutes":6,"source":"hashnode","status":"PUBLISHED","engagement_score":100,"like_count":29,"comment_count":16,"share_count":0,"is_trending":false},{"id":"hashnode-67e172db7e8e429374a7dd26","title":"Amazon Bedrock: A Practical Guide for Developers and DevOps Engineers","content":"<p>Once upon a time, building AI applications required deep experience with traditional technologies and some Machine Learning expertise.

So, this article will serve as an <strong>A-Z guide</strong> for people who are interested in using Bedrock to build their generative AI applications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-please-support-microtica\"><strong>Please, support Microtica 😅 🙏</strong></h2>\n<p>Before moving on, I’d love it if you could support our work at Microtica joining our community! ⭐️</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.gg/N8WdXyXxZR\"><strong>⭐️ Join Microtica’s Discord Community ⭐️</strong></a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media1.tenor.com/m/AEq_MsuoaXsAAAAd/leonardo-dicaprio-thank-you.gif\" alt /></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-what-is-amazon-bedrock\"><strong>What is Amazon Bedrock?</strong></h2>\n<p>Amazon Bedrock is a service that lets DevOps engineers and teams build gen AI applications. Instead of building or fine-tuning models manually, Amazon Bedrock uses foundational models from AI infrastructure providers to provide a ready-made API for developers to use easily. This approach removes the complexity that comes with building generative applications and working with underlying stacks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-benefits-of-amazon-bedrock\"><strong>Benefits of Amazon Bedrock</strong></h2>\n<p>Before getting in hands with Amazon Bedrock, I just thought it would be nice to share some benefits of Amazon Bedrock and include examples of how these benefits have a positive impact on your development workflow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Quicker Development</strong>: Compared to working manually, where you always have to work with models and fine-tune them, AWS lets you work with a single API. With this approach, you don’t have much to focus on. This approach saves a lot of time as it requires less effort than directly working with models.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: My colleague made an AI Assistant using Amazon Bedrock's text generation models without having to handle any ML models directly, which saved him time. He found this method quicker because he could add AI features in just a few days with an API call instead of spending months or weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>    %[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1mT6VjArKs&amp;list=PLY0znMeIrUg8SNQrtTDO5DQ1cjV81Zq3M&amp;index=7] </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Amazon Bedrock is built on AWS’s Cloud Infrastructure and uses models from various companies, including AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, DeepSeek, Luma, Meta, Mistral AI, and Stability AI. This enables teams to scale their applications easily and under heavy workloads, Bedrock ensures excellent application performance without requiring manual intervention.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: An e-commerce service using Amazon Bedrock for product recommendations can easily scale resources during shopping seasons without compromising performance or experiencing downtime.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Integration with AWS Ecosystem</strong>: As Amazon Bedrock is an AWS product, it seamlessly integrates with Amazon SageMaker, Lambda, and S3 for building, deploying, and managing applications.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: A bank using Amazon Bedrock for fraud detection can create automated workflows. For instance, AWS Lambda can identify suspicious transactions, save the reports in S3, and use SageMaker to check patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Amazon Bedrock has flexible pricing, so you only pay for what you use. Instead of spending a lot on expensive servers and models, you can use any of Bedrock’s models that you think will help save costs while still getting powerful AI features. You can take a look at this page for Amazon Bedrock's pricing models.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: One of my colleagues automated blog posts with Amazon Bedrock and only paid for the API requests she used, saving money on monitoring and fine-tuning AI models.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-getting-started-with-amazon-bedrock\"><strong>Getting Started with Amazon Bedrock 🚀</strong></h2>\n<p>Now, it’s time to prepare to get our hands dirty. In this section, we will look into doing the real work and the things you should have before getting started. Even though Amazon Bedrock can be used to accomplish many tasks, this article is focused only on building generative AI applications easily with the AWS Management Console.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-prerequisites-for-using-amazon-bedrock\"><strong>Prerequisites For Using Amazon Bedrock</strong></h3>\n<p>Before getting started with Amazon Bedrock, here are some things you need to have ready:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Basic Python Knowledge.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>An AWS Account</strong>: This is primary: to get started, you need to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_source=DEV&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=devrel\"><strong>create an AWS account</strong></a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>AWS Management Console</strong>: You need the console to interact with models if you don’t want to write code. Alternatively, you can use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AWS CLI</strong>: You can use the CLI to create AWS CLI profiles using the API. For instructions on how to use this option, refer to this documentation. This option requires some basic Python knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>IAM Permissions</strong>: You also need to assign the required IAM roles needed for Bedrock.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media1.tenor.com/m/IC_M1d1a0TsAAAAd/zohan-soletsgo.gif\" alt /></p>\n<p>In this article, we will be using the AWS Management Console option for operations. You can use the CLI option to go a bit hands-on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-basic-aiml-concepts\"><strong>Basic AI/ML Concepts</strong></h3>\n<p>Even though Amazon Bedrock helps with removing the complexities that come with building AI applications, a basic understanding of AI and ML is helpful because, even when using Amazon Bedrock, there are things you might encounter, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Foundational Models (FMs)</strong>: These are the pre-built AI models that Amazon Bedrock provides for operations in generative applications. You might wonder if AWS owns the entire model, but some are from different companies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Prompt Engineering:</strong> This is the process of creating and improving input prompts to help AI models produce accurate and great responses. Good prompt engineering improves the model's understanding and ensures it aligns with the output.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Model fine-tuning</strong>: With Amazon Bedrock, it’s possible to fine-tune models to your needs. You can always configure models to fit what you want; the approach for doing this is different from the manual approach.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-core-concepts-of-amazon-bedrock\"><strong>Core Concepts of Amazon Bedrock</strong></h2>\n<p>Now, let’s take a look at some key concepts of Amazon Bedrock - by having a glance at them, you’ll have a deeper understanding of how Amazon Bedrock works and how to get the best out of it</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-understanding-foundation-models\"><strong>Understanding Foundation Models</strong></h3>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some foundation models that Amazon Bedrock uses and things to consider before using them.</p>\n<p>To find the list of models you could work with, their capabilities, and their availability in your region, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html?utm_source=DEV&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=devrel\"><strong>refer to this guide</strong></a>. In that guide, you’ll see everything about the models and the types of outputs they generate—for example, image, text, or code.</p>\n<p>Here are some things you should consider before using any of the models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Use Case</strong>: You should know if the model aligns with your application’s needs. For example, if you’re building a chatbot that generates text for responses, you need to work with one of the models that support text for their outputs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Performance vs. Cost</strong>: Now, this is where the saying \"quality over quantity\" really matters. You need to think about two things: performance and cost. Some models work quickly but are usually expensive. If you want a model that fits your budget, you might have to find a balance between how well it performs and how much it costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Customization</strong>: Amazon Bedrock lets you adjust models for some uses. Depending on your needs, you might want a model that can be customized to fit your project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-amazon-bedrock-api\"><strong>Amazon Bedrock API</strong></h2>\n<p>Now, let's explore Amazon Bedrock's API and SDK and learn how to use them. First, we'll have a look at the API and learn how to work with the foundational models.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-overview\"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>\n<p>Apart from interacting with the service, Amazon Bedrock API allows you to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Work with the foundation models to generate text, create images, generate code</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Adjust the model’s behaviour with settings you can change.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Get information about the model, including its ARN and ID.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amazon Bedrock APIs use AWS's normal authentication and authorization methods, and that requires IAM roles and permissions for security.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-authentication-amp-access-control\"><strong>Authentication &amp; Access Control</strong></h3>\n<p>To use the Bedrock API, you need to install the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html?utm_source=DEV&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=devrel\"><strong>latest version of AWS CLI</strong></a> and log in with AWS IAM credentials.

What is it, what is it used for….? And also we will take a look at npm(Node Package Manager), is it a build tool? Perhaps not. Lets find out, shall we?</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-gradle\">Gradle</h2>\n<p>Gradle is an open-source build automation tool that's primarily used for Java projects but can handle projects in other languages as well. It uses a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) or Kotlin for scripting, which makes it highly flexible and powerful for managing dependencies, tasks, and builds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742870784835/12d13d19-456d-4046-a2df-f18e2987235d.avif\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>So similarly like Maven, Gradle is also a powerful project management tool which can be used for project management, dependencies resolution and application builds.</p>\n<p>But what makes it different from Maven? Why have two build tools providing the same function right?</p>\n<p><strong>Maven vs. Gradle: Key Differences</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Language and Configuration:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Maven:</strong> Utilizes XML for configuration, leading to a standardized but sometimes verbose setup.</p>\n<p>  <img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742871116825/2cfdd6b9-580b-42f9-91e1-cd28a22d477e.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Gradle:</strong> Employs a Groovy-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language) or Kotlin for configuration, offering a more concise and expressive syntax.​</p>\n<p>  <img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742871193323/ccdfe902-0fbd-4dd2-b3fd-37f3f04f7c92.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>  Doesn’t this look much cleaner and flexible to write?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Flexibility vs. Convention:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Maven:</strong> Emphasizes convention over configuration, providing a uniform project structure and build lifecycle, which simplifies onboarding but may limit customization.​</p>\n<p>  <img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742871255197/c4b8889c-7c21-46a3-af83-2b3a0954d430.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Gradle:</strong> Offers greater flexibility, allowing extensive customization of build processes, which is beneficial for complex projects requiring tailored build logic.​</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Performance:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Maven:</strong> Performs well but may experience longer build times as project complexity increases.​</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Gradle:</strong> Designed for high performance with features like incremental builds and build caching, resulting in faster build times, especially for large projects.​</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Thing here to understand is that, this doesn’t mean one is better than the other. Use either one based on project needs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Multi-Language Support:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Maven:</strong> Primarily focused on Java projects.​</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Gradle:</strong> Supports multiple programming languages, including Java, C++, and Python, making it versatile for polyglot projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I guess that give you a good idea how Maven and Gradle are different from one another. But now let us understand what are <strong>Incremental Builds and Caching in Gradle.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-1-incremental-builds\"><strong>1. Incremental Builds</strong></h3>\n<p>Gradle performs <strong>incremental builds</strong> by detecting what has changed since the last build and only executing necessary tasks instead of rebuilding everything from scratch.</p>\n<h4 id=\"heading-how-it-works\"><strong>How It Works:</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Gradle tracks <strong>task inputs and outputs</strong> (e.g., source files, dependencies, configurations).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If inputs haven't changed, the task is <strong>skipped</strong> because the output is already up to date.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If a file changes, Gradle <strong>rebuilds only the affected components</strong>, reducing overall build time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>✅ <strong>Example:</strong><br />If you modify a single Java class in a project, Gradle recompiles <strong>only that class</strong> instead of rebuilding the entire project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742872079547/9632d663-0cc2-4398-b4c8-50412c47b311.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"heading-2-build-cache\"><strong>2. Build Cache</strong></h3>\n<p>Gradle uses a <strong>build cache</strong> to <strong>store outputs of previously executed tasks</strong> and reuse them later, even across different builds or machines.</p>\n<h4 id=\"heading-types-of-caching\"><strong>Types of Caching:</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Local Cache:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Stores task outputs on the same machine.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If a task runs with the same inputs as a previous execution, Gradle reuses the cached output.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Remote Cache:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Enables teams to <strong>share build outputs</strong> across different machines.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Useful in CI/CD pipelines, where different agents can reuse cached results instead of rebuilding.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>✅ <strong>Example:</strong><br />If a CI server builds a project once and caches the results, subsequent builds on other agents can fetch the cached outputs instead of rebuilding everything.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742872019751/66b51cb9-1fd3-46d7-8a63-ed2ec1d9408e.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of Incremental Builds &amp; Caching</strong></p>\n<p>✔ <strong>Faster builds</strong> – Reduces compilation time by skipping unnecessary work.<br />✔ <strong>Efficient CI/CD pipelines</strong> – Saves resources by reusing existing build outputs.<br />✔ <strong>Better scalability</strong> – Works well in large codebases where full rebuilds are expensive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-gradle-project-structure\">Gradle Project Structure</h3>\n<p>In a typical Gradle-based Java project, the structure often follows conventions, but it's customizable based on project needs. Here’s a simplified example structure:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">cssCopyEditmy-java-project/\n│\n├── build.gradle       (Project-wide build script)\n├── settings.gradle    (Settings <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span> the Gradle project)\n│\n├── src/\n│   ├── main/\n│   │   ├── java/      (Main Java <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">source</span> code)\n│   │   └── resources/ (Resources like properties files)\n│   │\n│   └── <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">test</span>/\n│       ├── java/      (Test <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">source</span> code)\n│       └── resources/ (Test resources)\n│\n└── build/              (Generated build output)\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see how similar the project structure is compared to a Maven project. The only observable difference is the final build out folder (for maven it was the target folder) and the main configuration script build.gradle file (for maven it was the pom.xml file).</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-important-files-in-gradle-projects\">Important Files in Gradle Projects</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>build.gradle:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>This is the core build script for the entire project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It defines dependencies, plugins, tasks, and other configurations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You'll specify things like Java version, plugins (e.g., Java plugin), dependencies (libraries your project relies on), and custom tasks.</p>\n<p>  <img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742871193323/ccdfe902-0fbd-4dd2-b3fd-37f3f04f7c92.png\" alt /></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>settings.gradle:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>This file includes settings for the Gradle project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It can define which subprojects are part of the build and other global settings.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To initialize a Gradle project use :</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">gradle init\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure Gradle is installed on your system. Executing this command on the CLI will show you a bunch of options such as type of the project, programming language of implementation, type of build script, etc.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742872678533/83dd9fc6-2735-4bc2-babc-008caa9239dd.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742872834790/befa8aed-59a9-4e12-96b3-33ab21fe4aeb.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>And there you go, a Java-Gradle project is has been successfully initialized.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong> : A very important thing here to note is that both Maven and Gradle use the same Maven central repository for dependencies resolution!</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-gradle-wrapper\">Gradle Wrapper</h3>\n<p><strong>gradlew and gradlew.bat:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>These are shell scripts (Unix) and batch scripts (Windows), respectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They bootstrap the Gradle environment for the project without requiring a pre-installed Gradle distribution on each developer's machine.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"heading-purpose-of-gradle-wrapper\">Purpose of Gradle Wrapper</h3>\n<p>The Gradle Wrapper ensures that everyone working on the project uses the exact version of Gradle specified by the wrapper configuration. This consistency helps avoid issues caused by different Gradle versions across developers' environments. It also simplifies setup for new developers joining the project, as they only need Java installed, and Gradle will be automatically downloaded as needed by the wrapper scripts.</p>\n<p>To build a Gradle project and create the application artifact we use the gradle wrapper command :</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">./gradlew build\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742873280381/a5c08418-7a7a-4f24-a04f-1f1932aa4207.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742873353045/06f3a91b-e4d7-4a0e-a0b9-49ad050c9063.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>And there you go, application artifact is successfully built under ./build/libs folder. The ./build folder also contains folders such as classes, resources, test-results which store compiled classes and executed unit test results in form of a HTML file.</p>\n<p>Now this .jar artifact can we used to distribute and run the application on the server similar to Maven!</p>\n<p>And that’s all about Gradle you need to know to begin with! Get going on your own Gradle or Maven projects right now!</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-npm-node-package-manager\">npm ( Node Package Manager)</h2>\n<p>So we studied build tools for Java based applications, but what if you are developing an application using JavaScript ?</p>\n<p>JavaScript Applications do not have special artifact types, they can just be packed into a .zip or a .tar file.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-what-is-npm\">What is npm?</h3>\n<p>npm stands for Node Package Manager. It is primarily a package manager for JavaScript, and it comes bundled with Node.js installation. npm allows developers to discover, share, and reuse packages of code from hundreds of thousands of developers — and assemble them in powerful new ways.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-is-npm-a-build-tool-or-a-package-manager\">Is npm a Build Tool or a Package Manager?</h3>\n<p>npm is primarily a package manager rather than a build tool. Its primary function is to manage dependencies and package distribution rather than transpiling, compressing and building the application artifact.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-applications-of-npm\">Applications of npm</h3>\n<p>npm is used primarily for managing dependencies in JavaScript applications, including Node.js applications, front-end web development projects, and even in some cases, in backend services built with Node.js. npm uses the npm central repository to handle installation of dependencies unless specified anything else.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742879320774/4a1242af-ae9c-42b9-bd2b-95d92805ce43.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-handling-dependencies\">Handling Dependencies</h3>\n<p>npm handles dependencies by defining them in a <code>package.json</code> file. This file lists all dependencies (both direct and indirect) required for the project. When you install a package using <code>npm install</code>, it reads the <code>package.json</code> and installs the required dependencies recursively.</p>\n<p>The package.json file which is written using JSON is equivalent to the pom.xml or build.gradle file.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742879597430/ee9ecee0-57fd-4fd9-8f22-03bd5b1e53f3.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-packagejson-vs-package-lockjson\">package.json vs package-lock.json</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>package.json</strong>: This file is where the metadata about a project and its dependencies are stored. It includes information such as project name, version, description, entry points, and most importantly, dependencies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>package-lock.json</strong>: Introduced in npm 5, this file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the <code>node_modules</code> tree or <code>package.json</code>. It locks down the versions of dependencies to ensure consistent installs across different machines.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>node_modules</code>folder is created in your project directory having installed all the dependencies mentioned in the <code>package.json</code> file once we execute the npm install command.</p>\n<p>So you might be wondering what will be the workflow of the JavaScript applications if npm does not produce a application artifact?</p>\n<p>We can either use <code>npm pack</code> command. When you run <code>npm pack</code>, it creates a compressed tarball (.tgz file) of your package. This tarball includes the source code, <code>package.json</code>, and other necessary files, but it does not include dependencies unless explicitly included in your project. To run the application of the server you must install the dependencies first, unpack this zip or tar file and then run the application using the appropriate script command!</p>\n<p>Let me show you an example of how <strong>npm</strong> can be used in containerized environments:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742880090456/d0ab8df4-eff6-4391-8860-5a7ad91c9ab0.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>So basically here is a <strong>Dockerfile</strong> I wrote for a frontend microservice of a MERN stack application, similarly as mentioned above what I did is :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Created a <code>/app</code> directory inside the Docker container</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Copied my <code>package.json</code> file inside the container in the /app folder</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Installed the dependencies first</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Then copied the source code of the application inside the <code>/app</code> folder.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>And then finally executed the script command to run the application!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And well that’s it, your JavaScript application is running inside your container on the specified port.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-npm-scripts-npm-start-npm-stop-npm-test-npm-publish\">npm Scripts (<code>npm start</code>, <code>npm stop</code>, <code>npm test</code>, <code>npm publish</code>)</h3>\n<p>These commands are defined in the <code>scripts</code> section of <code>package.json</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>npm start</code>: Typically used to start the application. It is customizable and can run any Node.js command.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>npm stop</code>: Can be used to stop a running application or server.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>npm test</code>: Executes tests defined in the <code>scripts</code> section.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>npm publish</code>: Publishes the package to the npm registry, making it available for others to install.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this is just for your additional information but :</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-using-webpack-to-bundle\">Using webpack to Bundle</h3>\n<p>webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. webpack bundles all your assets, including JavaScript, CSS, images, and fonts, into a smaller number of bundles (usually one) to be served to the browser. It helps in optimizing performance by reducing the number of requests made to the server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Alright we have explored build tools such as <strong>Maven</strong> and <strong>Gradle</strong> used to build and manage Java based projects and <strong>npm</strong> which is package management tool used for Java-Script based applications.

Before we dive into the code, let's quickly recap the core principles of Onion Architecture. If you want a more in-depth look, you can always check out my previous post on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://anilgurau.hashnode.dev/why-choose-onion-architecture-for-better-software-development-practices\">https://anilgurau.hashnode.dev/why-choose-onion-architecture-for-better-software-development-practicese</a>.</p>\n<p>But for those who just need a quick refresher, here's the gist:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743036577620/c692b514-09b0-4697-a94f-d5275d7a1f4e.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, the key idea is that dependencies point inwards, towards the domain core. But there's another crucial aspect: layers communicate exclusively through abstractions, not concrete implementations. This keeps our application flexible, maintainable, and testable. Each layer has a specific responsibility, and we'll be exploring how to implement them step by step in the following posts.</p>\n<p>We're going to focus on the practical application of these principles, so let's get started!</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-project-setup-creating-the-solution-and-layers\">Project Setup: Creating the Solution and Layers</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Create Solution and Solution Folders:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In Visual Studio, create a new \"Blank Solution\" named \"<code>OnionArchitectureGuide</code>\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Create Solution Folders named \"Core\", \"Infrastructure\", and \"Presentation\".</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Create Domain Layer:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Inside the \"Core\" Solution Folder, add a new \"Class Library (.NET Standard/.NET Library)\" project named \"<code>OnionArchitectureGuide.Domain</code>\".</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Create Application Layer:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Inside the \"Core\" Solution Folder, add a new \"Class Library (.NET Standard/.NET Library)\" project named \"<code>OnionArchitectureGuide.Application.Abstraction</code>\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Inside the \"Core\" Solution Folder, add a new \"Class Library (.NET Standard/.NET Library)\" project named \"<code>OnionArchitectureGuide.Application.Implementation</code>\".</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Create Infrastructure Layer:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Inside the \"Infrastructure\" Solution Folder, add a new \"Class Library (.NET Standard/.NET Library)\" project named \"<code>OnionArchitectureGuide.Persistence</code>\".</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Create Presentation Layer:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Inside the \"Presentation\" Solution Folder, add a new \"ASP.NET Core Web API\" project named \"<code>OnionArchitectureGuide.Api</code>\".</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>    <strong>Note:</strong> Application layer is split into <code>OnionArchitectureGuide.Application.Abstraction</code> and <code>OnionArchitectureGuide.Application.Implementation</code>. The Presentation layer communicates with the Application layer, but it should not have direct access to implementations. Placing service interfaces and their implementations together violates the principles of Onion Architecture and creates tight coupling between layers. The outer layer should interact with the inner layer only through abstractions, not concrete implementations.</p>\n<p>Your Folder Structure Look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743043079247/e4962ad9-99a9-42c9-9295-ee3c04ddf58c.png\" alt /></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-setting-up-project-dependencies\"><strong>Setting up Project Dependencies:</strong></h2>\n<p>Now, we need to set up the project dependencies according to the Onion Architecture principles.

The API depends on the Application layer, and Infrastructure depends on the Application and Domain Layer, and finally Application layer depends on the Domain layer. This keeps our core logic independent and allows us to easily swap out implementations. This inward dependency flow also ensures that changes in outer layers have minimal impact on the inner layers, enhancing stability.

If you're running anything on AWS—or hell, even thinking about it—you need to understand <strong>load balancing</strong>. You can't just throw traffic at a single server and hope for the best. That’s amateur hour. AWS gives you four different types of load balancers, and if you don’t know what they do, you're basically walking into a gunfight with a butter knife.</p>\n<p>So let’s break this down in a way that actually makes sense. No corporate jargon, no fluff. Just raw, aggressive knowledge so you can make smart choices.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"heading-the-four-load-balancers-you-need-to-know\"><strong>The Four Load Balancers You Need to Know</strong></h2>\n<p>AWS doesn’t have just <em>one</em> load balancer. Oh no, that would be too easy. Instead, they give you <strong>four</strong>, and each of them serves a different purpose. Let’s get into it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"heading-1-classic-load-balancer-clb-the-old-grandpa-of-load-balancers\"><strong>1. Classic Load Balancer (CLB) – The Old Grandpa of Load Balancers</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"heading-how-clb-works-or-barely-works\"><strong>How CLB Works (or Barely Works)</strong></h3>\n<p>The <strong>Classic Load Balancer (CLB)</strong> is the dinosaur of AWS. It operates at <strong>Layer 4 (Transport Layer) and Layer 7 (Application Layer)</strong> and just kind of throws traffic at EC2 instances based on very basic health checks. This was great in 2010. Now? It’s basically on life support.</p>\n<p>Here’s what happens when you send traffic to a CLB:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The CLB gets your request and checks which backend EC2 instances are still alive.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It distributes traffic using <strong>round-robin</strong> (if it’s HTTP) or <strong>least outstanding requests</strong> (for TCP).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If an instance dies, it stops sending traffic to it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"heading-why-clb-is-garbage-but-sometimes-necessary\"><strong>Why CLB is Garbage (But Sometimes Necessary)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>No smart routing.</strong> It doesn’t know or care what’s in your HTTP headers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>No WebSockets or HTTP/2.</strong> Welcome to 2010, baby.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Slower and more expensive than ALB or NLB.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"heading-when-would-you-use-this\"><strong>When Would You Use This?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>If you're maintaining an ancient AWS setup.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>If you literally have no other option.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>If you enjoy suffering.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"heading-2-application-load-balancer-alb-the-smart-one\"><strong>2. Application Load Balancer (ALB) – The Smart One</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"heading-how-alb-works\"><strong>How ALB Works</strong></h3>\n<p>The <strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB)</strong> is the load balancer you actually want for web apps and APIs. It operates at <strong>Layer 7 (Application Layer)</strong>, which means it actually understands HTTP and can route traffic <strong>intelligently</strong>. Basically, Sherlock Holmes of Load Balancers.</p>\n<p>Here’s what happens when a request hits the ALB:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>ALB inspects the <strong>HTTP request</strong>, looking at the URL, headers, and parameters.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It decides <strong>which backend</strong> should handle it based on pre-set rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the backend is down, it automatically redirects traffic elsewhere.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It supports <strong>WebSockets, HTTP/2, and TLS termination</strong>, making it a beast for modern web apps.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"heading-why-alb-is-a-no-brainer\"><strong>Why ALB is a No-Brainer</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Path-based routing</strong> (e.g., <code>/api</code> goes one place, <code>/blog</code> goes another).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Host-based routing</strong> (e.g., <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shop.example.com\"><code>shop.example.com</code></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://api.example.com\"><code>api.example.com</code></a> can go to different places).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Header, Query String-based routing.</strong> Want to send mobile users to one server and desktop users to another? Done.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Integrated authentication.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"heading-when-should-you-use-alb\"><strong>When Should You Use ALB?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Web apps, REST APIs, and microservices.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Kubernetes (EKS) and container-based workloads.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Anytime you need intelligent request routing.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743245640964/a0d4ee86-fd30-461d-97b2-fdf483c22e97.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"heading-3-network-load-balancer-nlb-the-speed-demon\"><strong>3. Network Load Balancer (NLB) – The Speed Demon</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"heading-how-nlb-works\"><strong>How NLB Works</strong></h3>\n<p>The <strong>Network Load Balancer (NLB)</strong> is all about <strong>raw speed</strong>. It operates at <strong>Layer 4 (Transport Layer - TCP/UDP)</strong> and doesn’t give a damn about HTTP requests. It just forwards traffic <strong>as fast as humanly possible</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here’s what happens when a request hits the NLB:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>It picks a backend server based on <strong>flow hash algorithms</strong> (which keeps requests from the same client going to the same server).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It forwards the request with <strong>single-digit millisecond latency</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It supports <strong>millions of connections per second</strong>. Yes, <em>millions</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"heading-why-nlb-is-a-beast\"><strong>Why NLB is a Beast</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Handles TCP, UDP, and TLS connections with almost zero overhead.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Has static IP addresses</strong> (unlike ALB, which uses DNS-based routing).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Scales like a monster.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"heading-when-should-you-use-nlb\"><strong>When Should You Use NLB?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Real-time apps like VoIP, gaming, and financial trading.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Any high-performance, low-latency app that needs static IPs.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>If you need to handle millions of connections.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"heading-4-gateway-load-balancer-gwlb-the-security-bouncer\"><strong>4. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) – The Security Bouncer</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"heading-how-gwlb-works\"><strong>How GWLB Works</strong></h3>\n<p>The <strong>Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)</strong> is a different beast. It doesn’t balance traffic for web apps—it acts as a <strong>traffic cop for security appliances</strong> like firewalls, IDS, and deep packet inspection tools. It operates at <strong>Layer 3 (Network Layer)</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here’s what happens when traffic hits a GWLB:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>It <strong>forwards traffic to a security appliance</strong> (like a firewall or intrusion detection system).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The security appliance inspects the traffic for threats.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If it’s safe, GWLB forwards it to the destination.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"heading-why-gwlb-is-a-game-changer\"><strong>Why GWLB is a Game-Changer</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Centralized security.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Seamless integration with AWS security tools.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Ensures all traffic is inspected before hitting your applications.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"heading-when-should-you-use-gwlb\"><strong>When Should You Use GWLB?</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>If you need enterprise-grade network security.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>If you’re running compliance-heavy workloads.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>If you want deep packet inspection before traffic hits your VPC.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"heading-heres-something-extra-about-gwlb\"><strong>Here’s Something Extra about GWLB</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)</strong>—the only one in the load balancing family that actually uses <strong>route tables</strong>. Why? Because it operates at <strong>Layer 3 (network layer)</strong> and, unlike its other Load balancer siblings, GLWB needs to read this so this so that it can ensure everything flows smoothly at the <strong>network gateway level</strong> between <strong>cloud, on-prem, and across regions</strong>.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB)?</strong> They don’t bother with route tables because, well, they don’t <em>have to</em>. <strong>ALB</strong> is living the high life at <strong>Layer 7</strong>, routing traffic based on <em>content</em> like HTTP headers and SSL session IDs—it’s basically the load balancer equivalent of a food critic, analyzing every detail before making a decision. <strong>NLB</strong>, down at <strong>Layer 4</strong>, keeps things more straightforward, handling traffic based on <strong>ports and IP addresses</strong>, just distributing connections like a robot with a checklist. So they already know how to do their job and not have to bother with reading ‘route table’ manual.</p>\n<p>So, while <strong>GLB is just trying it’s best</strong>, ALB and NLB are just out here <em>vibing!</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"heading-which-load-balancer-should-you-use\"><strong>Which Load Balancer Should You Use?</strong></h2>\n<p>AWS doesn’t give you four load balancers just for fun. Each one has a <strong>specific</strong> purpose. Here’s what you should use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>ALB</strong> → If you need smart HTTP routing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>NLB</strong> → If you need ultra-fast, low-latency TCP/UDP balancing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>GWLB</strong> → If you need security inspection before traffic hits your apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>CLB</strong> → If you’re stuck in the past (or migrating away from it).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Load balancing isn’t optional—it’s <strong>how you keep your applications from dying under load</strong>. Now you know which one to use. No excuses.</p>\n<hr />\n","subtitle":"Listen up, because this is important.

created an HTML doc and merged in the Markdown text using a placeholder and the <code>Substitute()</code> function. For the graph view, we’ll use the same approach, but we need to merge in JSON data to feed the graph. If your file is hosted on FileMaker server, I highly recommend using the FileMaker Data API to fetch your records as JSON. This is much easier than using a script or calculation, and it’s more efficient because the server handles the load and it does it in a single request, instead of looping through records.</p>\n<p>However, in my case, I’m building this file locally and I wanted others to be able to test it without hosting the file. So we’re gonna do it the hard way with a script.</p>\n<p>Create a new script called Build JSON. Then use a <code>While()</code> loop and <code>ExecuteSQL()</code> to convert your notes into a JSON array.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-plaintext\">Set Variable [ $$noteJson; \n  Value: While (\n    [\n      ~delim = \"|\" ;\n      ~sql = \"SELECT \\\"id\\\", \\\"title\\\", \\\"tags\\\", \\\"project\\\", \\\"created_by\\\" FROM \\\"notes\\\"\" ;\n      ~result = ExecuteSQL ( ~sql ; ~delim; ¶ ) ;\n      ~rowCount = ValueCount ( ~result ) ;\n      ~i = 0 ;\n      ~output = JSONSetElement ( \"\" ; \"\" ; \"[]\" ; JSONString )\n    ] ;\n\n    ~i &lt; ~rowCount ;\n\n    [\n      ~row = GetValue ( ~result ; ~i + 1 ) ;\n      ~fields = Substitute ( ~row ; ~delim ; \"¶\" ) ;\n      ~id = GetValue ( ~fields ; 1 ) ;\n      ~title = GetValue ( ~fields ; 2 ) ;\n      ~tags = GetValue ( ~fields ; 3 ) ;\n      ~project = GetValue ( ~fields ; 4 ) ;\n      ~created_by = GetValue ( ~fields ; 5 ) ;\n\n      ~json = JSONSetElement ( \"{}\" ;\n        [ \"id\" ; ~id ; JSONString ] ;\n        [ \"title\" ; ~title ; JSONString ] ;\n        [ \"tags\" ; ~tags ; JSONString ] ;\n        [ \"project\" ; ~project ; JSONString ] ;\n        [ \"created_by\" ; ~created_by ; JSONString ]\n      ) ;\n\n      ~output = JSONSetElement ( ~output ; \"[\" &amp; ~i &amp; \"]\" ; ~json ; JSONObject ) ;\n      ~i = ~i + 1\n    ] ;\n\n    ~output\n  ) \n]\n\n// Optional: Show result\n// Show Custom Dialog [ Message: $$noteJson; Default Button: “OK”, Commit: “Yes”; Button 2: “Cancel”, Commit: “No” ]\n\nSet Web Viewer [ Object Name: \"webviewer\"; Action: Reload ]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will save the JSON to a global <code>$$notesJson</code> variable that we can merge into the new web viewer for the graph view. Set this script to run <em>On Record Load</em>, so that the graph view can update whenever records are navigated.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can call the FileMaker Data API in your script to get the JSON, then set the global variable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743935361003/ee0670bd-cfa9-4b5e-acbb-51ebc1d413b7.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-building-the-graph-view-with-visjs\">Building the graph view with Vis.js</h2>\n<p>Next, add a new web viewer, and a text object to store the HTML.

GitHub Copilot Agent Mode)","content":"<p>Hello and welcome to another Articles by Victoria! This weekend, my friends and I have been talking a lot about the revolutionary AI tools we see emerging. We came across the term \"vibe coding,\" which apparently describes the art of coding without actually doing it yourself— an AI handles it for you.</p>\n<p>The term sounds strange to me. As someone who spends hours actually coding, I love the \"vibe\" of real coding and being in the flow state.</p>\n<p>So in today’s article, let’s explore what Vibe Coding actually is, how you can do it yourself and what is means for the future of software developers.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-what-is-vibe-coding\">What is Vibe Coding?</h1>\n<p>Vibe coding is the practice of AI-dependent programming where anyone - non-coders and coders, engage with AI tools to prompt, describe and build their own software. From desktop or web apps to mobile apps, anything that can be written with code can be achieved with vibe coding (in theory).</p>\n<p>A quick lookup on the web and I found out the term was coined by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/karpathy\">Andrej Karpathy</a>, previously Director of AI at Tesla, and a member of the founding team at OpenAI. This is his original definition of ‘Vibe Coding’:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. […] I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So now that we have an understanding of vibe coding, let’s learn how to actually be a ‘vibe coder’.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-how-to-vibe-code\">How to Vibe Code?</h1>\n<p>To be honest, while writing this article, I was skeptical about how non-coders could truly rely on AI to handle everything. I had many questions running through my mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Wouldn’t there be bugs or inefficiencies in the code that only a human could catch and optimize?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What about system design and programming patterns—doesn’t AI still need guidance to implement them effectively?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How complex can an AI-generated app really be, especially for someone who codes more by intuition than strict methodology?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>And if AI does all the heavy lifting, what happens to the deeper problem-solving skills that come with traditional coding?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vibe coding is all about working with AI as a collaborator rather than just a tool. The key is to <strong>learn how to interact with AI efficiently</strong>—like giving clear, concise instructions and iterating based on feedback.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you can start:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Pick an AI-powered coding assistant</strong> – Tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or ChatGPT can help you generate code snippets based on descriptions. For this article, I’m using Github Copilot Agent Mode since I have the paid plan.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Describe what you need, not how to do it</strong> – Instead of writing step-by-step logic, tell the AI what you want, e.g., “Create a user authentication system with JWT tokens.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Refine and iterate</strong> – The AI might not get it perfect the first time, but you can tweak and refine through additional prompts. This process will take the longest for those who rarely prompts AI tools. The intuition and skill of prompt engineering takes time to build.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Use AI to debug and optimize</strong> – When you run into issues, let the AI analyze error messages and suggest fixes. CTRL + C and CTRL + V (sorry Mac users) are your best friends.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want, I can write a separate article on the details on how to setup, configure and use different AI models, both free and paid, for vibe coding. Do let me know in the comments!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"heading-using-github-copilot-agent-mode-to-build-a-simple-app-with-vibe-coding\">Using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode to build a simple app with Vibe Coding</h1>\n<p>A while back, I published an article comparing 3 coding generation tools, one of them being GitHub Copilot. But now, GitHub has released <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/\">GitHub Copilot Agent Mode</a> (available in preview) and since I’m curious to see how far I could take vibe coding, I decided to put it to the test using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrapper\"><div class=\"embed-loading\"><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div><div class=\"loadingRow\"></div></div><a class=\"embed-card\" href=\"https://lo-victoria.com/a-comparison-of-ai-coding-tools-github-copilot-qodo-and-codeium\">https://lo-victoria.com/a-comparison-of-ai-coding-tools-github-copilot-qodo-and-codeium</a></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-step-1-download-visual-studio-code-insiders\">Step 1: Download Visual Studio Code - Insiders</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\">link</a> to download</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-step-2-open-vs-code-insiders-and-setup-copilot\">Step 2: Open VS Code Insiders and Setup Copilot</h2>\n<p>The instructions are pretty clear and they have an onboarding window as soon as you launch Insiders.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743241329809/7917904d-2a04-4807-a38c-06adfdaa7f8c.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>Once your Copilot chat window shows up, make sure the action dropdown is set to new “Agent” mode.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743241634445/2c65d320-64d4-46bb-88ca-4f6d412e1e9f.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-step-3-start-vibe-coding\">Step 3: Start Vibe Coding</h2>\n<p>So for this example, I’m making a simple chatbot app using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.copilotkit.ai/\">CopilotKit</a>. The Agent does well by coding up a template from scratch. And then, it stops because I’m missing the API key. So I had to re-prompt to ask it to generate me the <code>.env</code> file to store it. Yes, I can easily create a single file myself but I want to be let AI code everything for this project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743246132687/9dc089ce-5615-49c8-b103-50d294741b07.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>And of course, I still had to manually paste my API key in the <code>.env</code> file. As I instruct the Agent to run the app, it told me that the initial code it generated have issues, so it immediately applies the fixes. But the fix was still causing errors so I gave it some help and copying the sample front-end code from the CopilotKit’s documentation. After that, it was fixed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743246564198/70cf3a1e-c555-4d8a-bfaf-9ae57282653e.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>My simple chatbot app is now up and running! Ta-da!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743247081654/1982ed7d-0659-4114-a5e1-38e6044f9ef9.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-verdict\"><strong>Verdict</strong></h1>\n<p>Vibe coding made app development feel effortless. Instead of manually writing code, I found myself interacting with AI in a conversational way, tweaking and refining as needed. However, some limitations quickly became apparent:</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-1-debugging-is-still-a-human-task\"><strong>1) Debugging is still a human task</strong></h2>\n<p>If I were the one building this from the start, I would have read CopilotKit’s documentation and knew that I can simply use their UI component.</p>\n<p>So when it generated a minor bug, I had to step in and debug manually. AI couldn’t always fix issues without my intervention. And trying to use AI to fix their own mistakes can take lots of unproductive attempts. If you are not using free tools, these costs can accumulate really fast!</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-2-ai-lacks-context-beyond-immediate-prompts\"><strong>2) AI lacks context beyond immediate prompts</strong></h2>\n<p>While Copilot generated individual functions well, it didn't always connect them in the most efficient way, requiring some human restructuring. For this example, the bugs that were generated from the Copilot Agent was because it didn’t know it had to check the docs and tried to implement its own UI for the chatbot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-3-optimization-requires-experience\"><strong>3) Optimization requires experience</strong></h2>\n<p>The AI-generated code worked, but it wasn’t necessarily the most optimized or scalable solution. A human touch was still needed to refine it. As someone who can read code, it’s obviously faster for me to optimize the code myself.</p>\n<p>Despite these drawbacks, the experience demonstrated how AI can dramatically speed up development, making coding more accessible to non-programmers and boosting productivity for experienced developers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-4-data-and-security-concerns\"><strong>4) Data and Security Concerns</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the biggest concerns with AI-driven development is the handling of sensitive data like the API key in the example. When relying on AI tools like Copilot or ChatGPT, code snippets and project details may be sent to external servers for processing. This raises questions about data privacy, security risks, and even licensing issues—especially for enterprise or proprietary projects. It’s essential to review the terms of use and ensure that confidential code isn’t inadvertently exposed.</p>\n<p>At the current limitations, vibe coding can only be used for <strong>rapid prototyping</strong> and would be beneficial for mainly coders. But it cannot replace software engineers who understand data structures, system design and how to build secure scalable apps.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-what-does-vibe-coding-mean-for-the-future-of-software-development\">What does Vibe Coding mean for the future of software development?</h1>\n<p>When ChatGPT first launched, I knew that prompt engineering is a skill that’s not to be underestimated. The AI can only generate solutions as good as the prompt. <strong>If you don’t prompt well, you can’t get good results. If you don’t know what you are doing, you can’t get good results.</strong></p>\n<p>Vibe Coding emphasizes the importance of this skill even more! The success of vibe coding a fully functional app all depends on your prompt engineering skill.</p>\n<p>For non-coders, I cannot imagine the process of building apps being smooth with no hiccups. AI can generate hallucinations and imperfect solutions occasionally. Knowing how to fix the AI’s mistakes and catching these mistakes before it snowballs into technical debt will be a daunting task for someone without a coding background.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The future of software development might not be about writing code but about shaping AI-generated solutions to fit specific needs. While AI-driven coding isn't perfect yet, its rapid advancements suggest a world where developers focus more on <strong>creativity and problem-solving</strong> than syntax and debugging.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a seasoned developer or someone with no coding experience, AI tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor are making it easier than ever to turn ideas into working software.</p>\n<p>I am quite excited and optimistic about the changes that vibe coding will bring. Because I don’t think vibe coding is about replacing programmers—it’s about enhancing the way we build. As AI continues to evolve, the role of developers will shift from writing code line-by-line to guiding AI-generated solutions, shaping the future of software development in ways we’re only beginning to explore.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Original tweet: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383\">https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lo-victoria.com/a-comparison-of-ai-coding-tools-github-copilot-qodo-and-codeium\">Code Generation tool comparison</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/\">GitHub Copilot Agent Mode</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.copilotkit.ai/quickstart\">CopilotKit documentation</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for reading!

In this article, we will discuss structured and unstructured tasks. You’ll see that their behavior can be tricky in some scenarios, but we’ll break it down into rules to make it clear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ : I assume you are familiar with the basic concepts of <strong>Structured Concurrency</strong> like <strong>async let</strong> and <strong>task group.</strong> If not, you can start <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"heading-structured-and-unstructured-tasks\"><strong>Structured and Unstructured Tasks</strong></h1>\n<p>From previous article, we know that to switch gears from sync context to async context we need to use tasks. However, that is not the only use case for tasks. Tasks are, in fact, a much broader concept in Swift Concurrency.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task\">Tasks</a> are <strong>units of asynchronous work</strong> you can run from your code.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Every async function is executing in a task</strong>. In other words, a <em>task</em> is to <em>asynchronous functions</em>, what a <em>thread</em> is to <em>synchronous functions.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A task runs one function at a time; a single task has no concurrency.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Synchronous functions do not necessarily run as part of a task, but they can.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of Structured Concurrency, there are 2 kinds of tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Structured Concurrency Tasks</strong> (we will call them simply Structured Tasks)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Represented by <strong>async let</strong> and <strong>task group</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Unstructured Concurrency Tasks</strong> (we will call them simply Unstructured Tasks)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Represented by <strong>regular unstructured task</strong> (<strong>Task { … })</strong> and <strong>detached task</strong> (<strong>Task.detached { … })</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>⁉️ : What is the difference between Structured and Unstructured tasks?</strong><br />Why they are actually called “structured” and “unstructured”? What does it mean? To understand the difference we need to understand the parent and child relation for tasks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"heading-parent-and-child-tasks\"><strong>Parent and Child Tasks</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Parent Task is</strong> a task that spawns one or more subtasks (child tasks). Parent task is responsible for managing its child tasks.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Child Task</strong> is a subtask created within the context of a parent task. Child tasks return their results (if any) to the parent task (if explicitly awaited).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Parent and child tasks together form a <strong>task tree structure</strong>, that simplifies control over related tasks completion, cancellation and resource management.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743868803871/d21551a2-5365-4f27-a7de-a7f0ceac769c.png\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Root Task</strong> is an <strong>initial</strong> task in task tree (root node), which can be <strong>parent</strong> if it spawns child tasks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Structured task</strong> can be a <strong>child or parent task (or both).

Swift concurrency uses a cooperative cancellation model. Each task checks (with <strong>Task.isCancelled</strong> or <strong>Task.checkCancellation()</strong>) whether it has been canceled at the appropriate points in its execution, and responds to cancellation appropriately. Depending on what work the task is doing, responding to cancellation usually means one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Throwing an error like <code>CancellationError</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Returning <code>nil</code> or an empty collection</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Returning the partially completed work</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let’s consider an example where we have child structured task and parent unstructured task:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-swift\"><span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">asyncWork</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span></span> async {\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">do</span> {\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">/// If current task is canceled before the time ends,</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">/// sleep function throws `CancellationError`.</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">try</span> await <span class=\"hljs-type\">Task</span>.sleep(nanoseconds: <span class=\"hljs-number\">10_000_000_000</span>) <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// 10 secs</span>\n    } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">catch</span> {\n        <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">print</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Cancelled as a child task with \\\\(error)\"</span>)\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span>\n    }\n    <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">print</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Not cancelled -&gt; not child task!\"</span>)\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> parentTask = <span class=\"hljs-type\">Task</span> {\n    async <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> result = asyncWork()\n    await result\n}\nparentTask.cancel()\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Prints:</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// \"Cancelled as a child task with CancellationError()\" </span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// right after parentTask cancellation</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once <strong>unstructured task</strong> can only be a root task in a task tree, it can’t be cancelled automatically (has no parent). It can be cancelled only explicitly with <code>cancel()</code> method. Doing that will cancel all child structured tasks in the task tree. That means 👉 <strong>Group Cancellation Rule works as expected</strong> ✅ for structured tasks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>⁉️ : Can we cancel single structured child task without cancelling it’s parent task?</strong> To cancel single async lets child task, we have to cancel parent task, which will cancel all child tasks together.

However, keep in mind that any async functions you call within these tasks can have their own actor isolation. For <code>async let</code>, once it is assigned with an async function call, it may look like as though it inherits the actor isolation of that function.

The task group’s \"first thrown, first caught\" logic is more predictable and won’t be affected by the order of awaiting, unlike <code>async let</code>, where error propagation can be influenced by the awaiting order.

It sounds amazing: your code scales up automatically, you only pay when it runs, and you don't have to worry about servers. Tools like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB make this possible.</p>\n<p>Getting started is pretty easy. You can set up a basic function with a few clicks or a simple template. But using these tools for a <em>real</em> application, one that customers use every day? That's when things get interesting, and you start learning lessons you didn't expect.</p>\n<p>Our team jumped into serverless for some important projects because the benefits looked great. And they often are! But it wasn't always easy. We ran into some surprises. Here are the biggest things we learned the hard way while running serverless apps in production.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lesson-1-you-need-to-see-what-your-code-is-doing\">Lesson 1: You Need to See What Your Code is Doing</h2>\n<p><strong>What We Thought:</strong> \"We have logs, just like our old apps. That's probably fine.\"</p>\n<p><strong>What Really Happened:</strong> We were wrong! When serverless code runs across many small pieces (Lambda, API Gateway, databases), figuring out problems is much harder than with one big application. If something broke, finding the cause felt like searching for a needle in a haystack – actually, <em>multiple</em> haystacks! It took forever to track down simple errors.</p>\n<p><strong>How We Fixed It:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Better Logs:</strong> We made sure all our logs were in a consistent format (JSON) with important info like a unique ID to track each request as it moved between services. This made searching logs much easier.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Using AWS X-Ray:</strong> Think of X-Ray like a map for your requests. It shows you exactly where a request went, how long each step took, and where things slowed down or failed. It was a huge help for finding problems quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Better Alerts:</strong> Basic alerts tell you if a function crashed. But we started adding alerts for <em>business</em> problems (like \"failed orders\") and watching for high error rates. This way, we often knew about issues <em>before</em> users started complaining.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lesson-2-keep-an-eye-on-your-spending\">Lesson 2: Keep an Eye on Your Spending</h2>\n<p><strong>What We Thought:</strong> \"Pay-per-use sounds cheap! We only pay when it runs.\"</p>\n<p><strong>What Really Happened:</strong> Serverless <em>can</em> be cheap, but costs can sneak up on you if you're not careful. We found out the hard way. Maybe a function ran too long or used too much memory. Maybe a bug caused a function to call itself over and over. Maybe we logged way too much information. One small mistake even caused millions of function runs over a weekend, costing us real money!</p>\n<p><strong>How We Fixed It:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Check the Bill Often:</strong> We started using AWS tools (like Cost Explorer) regularly to see exactly where the money was going. Adding \"tags\" (labels) to everything helped us sort costs by project or service.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Set Spending Limits (Budgets):</strong> We set up AWS Budgets to send us alerts if costs started getting too high. This gave us a warning <em>before</em> the end of the month.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Give Functions the Right Resources:</strong> We stopped guessing how much memory our Lambda functions needed. We looked at the actual usage and adjusted them – not too much (wasteful), not too little (slow or failing).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Think About Costs When Designing:</strong> We started thinking about how different choices affect the price. For example, sometimes grouping messages together is cheaper than sending lots of small ones.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lesson-3-sometimes-serverless-is-slow-at-first-cold-starts\">Lesson 3: Sometimes Serverless is Slow at First (Cold Starts)</h2>\n<p><strong>What We Thought:</strong> \"Lambda scales up instantly!\"</p>\n<p><strong>What Really Happened:</strong> Mostly, yes. But when a function hasn't run for a little while, the <em>very first</em> request takes extra time to start up. This is called a \"cold start.\" It might only be a second or two, but if a user is waiting for an answer from your API, that delay feels really bad.</p>\n<p><strong>How We Fixed It:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Keep Some Functions Ready:</strong> For important functions where speed matters most, we use something called \"Provisioned Concurrency.\" It costs a bit extra, but it keeps some function instances warm and ready to go, eliminating cold starts.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Keep Code Small and Fast:</strong> Smaller code packages and fewer extra bits usually mean faster start times. We also learned to set up things like database connections <em>outside</em> the main part of the function, so they can be reused if the function stays warm.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Maybe Choose a Different Language:</strong> Some programming languages tend to start faster than others. We looked at which ones worked best for our needs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Don't Make Users Wait:</strong> If the work doesn't need to be done instantly, we often have the API just put a message in a queue (like SQS) and tell the user \"Got it!\". Then, another Lambda function processes the message in the background. The user doesn't notice any cold start delay.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lesson-4-handle-errors-carefully-especially-retries\">Lesson 4: Handle Errors Carefully (Especially Retries)</h2>\n<p><strong>What We Thought:</strong> \"If a function fails, things like SQS will just retry it automatically. Easy!\"</p>\n<p><strong>What Really Happened:</strong> Retries are great, but they can be dangerous! Imagine a function that charges a credit card. If it fails <em>after</em> charging but <em>before</em> saving the order, a simple retry might charge the customer <em>again</em>. We learned functions need to be \"safe to retry\" (the technical term is idempotent). Also, sometimes an error happens that retrying will <em>never</em> fix (like bad data). Retrying those just wastes time and money.</p>\n<p><strong>How We Fixed It:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Make Functions Safe to Retry:</strong> Before doing something important (like charging money or changing data), our functions now check if that exact task was <em>already</em> completed successfully, often using a unique ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Use a \"Dead-Letter Queue\" (DLQ):</strong> We set up a special queue (a DLQ) for messages that fail too many times. Instead of blocking everything, the failed message goes to the DLQ where we can look at it later and figure out what went wrong. We watch these DLQs closely!</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Catch Errors Smartly:</strong> Inside our functions, we started catching errors and thinking: Is this a temporary glitch (okay to retry)? Or is this a permanent problem (stop retrying, log the error, maybe send the message straight to the DLQ)?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lesson-5-use-code-to-set-up-your-aws-stuff-iac\">Lesson 5: Use Code to Set Up Your AWS Stuff (IaC)</h2>\n<p><strong>What We Thought:</strong> \"It's just a few functions, we can set them up by clicking in the AWS console.\"</p>\n<p><strong>What Really Happened:</strong> A real serverless app isn't \"just a few functions.\" It's usually lots of functions, API parts, database tables, queues, permissions, etc. Trying to manage all that by clicking around in different environments (like development, testing, production) is a recipe for mistakes and confusion. It's slow, hard to track changes, and easy to make environments different without meaning to.</p>\n<p><strong>How We Fixed It:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Define Everything in Code:</strong> We now use tools like AWS SAM, CDK, or Terraform to write code that describes <em>all</em> the AWS pieces our application needs. This code can be saved, shared, and versioned like any other code.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Automate Updates:</strong> We set up systems (called CI/CD pipelines) that automatically test and apply changes from our infrastructure code. This is much safer and faster than manual clicking.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Get Identical Environments:</strong> Using code makes it easy to create exact copies of our setup for testing or different stages. This helps avoid the \"it worked on my machine!\" problem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p>Serverless on AWS has been great for our team. It lets us move faster and build things that can handle huge amounts of traffic. But it's not magic. You need to learn how these distributed systems really work.</p>\n<p>Thinking about how to <em>see</em> what's happening, watching costs, dealing with cold starts, handling errors safely, and using code to manage your setup – these aren't optional extras. They are the key lessons we learned from using serverless for real. It takes some effort to learn this stuff, but once you do, you can really unlock the benefits of serverless on AWS.</p>\n<p>Our team dove headfirst into serverless for several key projects, lured by its compelling advantages. While we've absolutely reaped the benefits, the path wasn't always smooth. We encountered challenges we didn't anticipate based on the initial hype. Here are some of the most critical, hard-won lessons we learned operating serverless applications in the demanding environment of production on AWS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lesson-1-observability-isnt-a-feature-its-the-foundation\">Lesson 1: Observability Isn't a Feature, It's the Foundation</h2>\n<p><strong>The Naive Start:</strong> We initially figured, \"We have CloudWatch Logs, just like our old EC2 apps. That should be enough.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Production Pain:</strong> Wrong. Debugging a distributed serverless system is vastly different from troubleshooting a monolith. A single user click might ripple through API Gateway, multiple Lambda functions, DynamoDB reads/writes, and maybe even SQS queues. When things broke, piecing together that fragmented journey across dozens of separate log streams was excruciatingly slow. Finding the root cause of even simple errors felt like searching for needles in multiple haystacks simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>The Essential Fixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Structured Logging is Mandatory:</strong> We enforced strict JSON logging across all Lambda functions. Every log entry had to include key context like the <code>correlationId</code> (tracing the request across services), <code>userId</code> (if available), and specific function identifiers. This instantly made CloudWatch Logs Insights usable for actual debugging, not just viewing raw output.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Embrace AWS X-Ray:</strong> Distributed tracing isn't optional for serverless. Implementing X-Ray was a game-changer. Suddenly, we could visualize the entire request path, see exact timings for each hop (API Gateway -&gt; Lambda -&gt; DynamoDB), identify bottlenecks immediately, and pinpoint which downstream call failed. Enabling the basic tracing checkbox in Lambda is step one; instrumenting your code with the X-Ray SDK to create custom subsegments for specific business logic or SDK calls provides invaluable granularity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Go Beyond Basic Metrics:</strong> Lambda's built-in metrics (invocations, errors, duration, throttles) are crucial, but not enough. We started emitting custom CloudWatch Metrics directly from our functions for critical business actions (e.g., <code>OrdersProcessed</code>, <code>PaymentFailures</code>, <code>ItemsScanned</code>). We then built targeted CloudWatch Alarms on these custom metrics, plus critical technical metrics like high error rates (&gt;1%), DLQ depths (&gt;0), and persistent throttles. This shifted us from reactive debugging to proactive alerting.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lesson-2-serverless-costs-arent-magic-monitor-or-be-surprised\">Lesson 2: Serverless Costs Aren't Magic – Monitor or Be Surprised</h2>\n<p><strong>The Misconception:</strong> \"Pay-per-use means it's always cheap! If it doesn't run, we don't pay.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Production Reality:</strong> While often cheaper overall, serverless costs can explode unexpectedly if you're not careful. We learned this the hard way. Causes included: inefficient Lambda code (high memory and long duration), accidental recursive function calls leading to infinite loops, poorly tuned SQS retry policies causing functions to hammer a failing downstream service, and massive CloudWatch Logs ingestion from overly verbose logging. One misconfigured event trigger cost us hundreds of dollars over a weekend due to millions of unnecessary invocations.</p>\n<p><strong>The Cost Control Toolkit:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Cost Explorer is Your Best Friend:</strong> Regularly dive into AWS Cost Explorer. Tag everything (functions, tables, queues, APIs) religiously with project codes or service names. Filter by tags and services to understand exactly where your money is going. Identify the top cost drivers – is it Lambda compute, data transfer, DynamoDB reads, or CloudWatch Logs?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Set AWS Budgets with Alerts:</strong> Don't wait for the monthly bill. Set up AWS Budgets for specific services, tags, or your overall account, with alert thresholds (e.g., at 50%, 80%, 100% of expected spend). Get notified before costs spiral out of control.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Right-Size Your Functions (Continuously):</strong> Don't guess memory allocation. Analyze function performance using CloudWatch metrics or AWS Compute Optimizer. Over-provisioning wastes money directly; under-provisioning increases duration (costing more compute time) and can lead to timeouts. Finding the \"sweet spot\" often requires experimentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Architect with Cost in Mind:</strong> Understand the pricing models. Is API Gateway's per-request cost significant at your scale? Would batching SQS messages reduce Lambda invocations? Are you performing costly DynamoDB scans instead of efficient <code>Query</code> or <code>GetItem</code> operations? Is extensive DEBUG logging necessary in production, or can it be controlled via environment variables?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lesson-3-cold-starts-happen-mitigate-or-accept-the-latency\">Lesson 3: Cold Starts Happen – Mitigate or Accept the Latency</h2>\n<p><strong>The Oversimplification:</strong> \"Lambda scales instantly!\"</p>\n<p><strong>Production Reality:</strong> Yes, it scales out, but the first request to a new or inactive function instance incurs a \"cold start.\" This is the time AWS needs to provision the environment, download your code package, and initialize the runtime. For user-facing synchronous APIs via API Gateway, adding hundreds of milliseconds, or sometimes even seconds, of unpredictable latency during a cold start can lead to a terrible user experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategies for Mitigation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Provisioned Concurrency (The Big Gun):</strong> For your most latency-sensitive functions, Provisioned Concurrency is the most effective solution. It keeps a specified number of execution environments warm and ready, eliminating cold starts for requests hitting those instances. Be aware: this incurs an additional cost, as you pay for the provisioned capacity whether it's used or not. Use it strategically.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Optimize Your Code &amp; Package:</strong> Keep your deployment artifacts small. Minimize dependencies; use tools like Webpack (for Node.js) or dependency pruning. Initialize expensive resources (like database connections or SDK clients) outside the main function handler. This allows them to be reused across multiple invocations within the same warm execution environment, reducing initialization time on subsequent requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Consider Runtime Choice:</strong> We observed differences. Node.js and Python generally have faster cold starts than Java (unless using optimizations like GraalVM). Compiled languages like Go can also be very fast. Benchmark and choose based on your application's needs and your team's expertise.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Design Asynchronously:</strong> Where possible, avoid making the user wait synchronously for long-running processes. An API Gateway endpoint could simply drop a message onto SQS and return a <code>202 Accepted</code> immediately. A separate Lambda function processes the message from the queue asynchronously. This masks the latency (including potential cold starts) of the background processing from the end-user.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lesson-4-idempotency-and-error-handling-are-non-negotiable\">Lesson 4: Idempotency and Error Handling Are Non-Negotiable</h2>\n<p><strong>The Initial Hope:</strong> \"Event sources like SQS have built-in retries, so we're covered if a function fails.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Production Reality:</strong> Retries are essential but dangerous if not handled carefully. If your function performs an action with side effects (charging a credit card, updating inventory, sending an email) and isn't idempotent (meaning running it multiple times with the same input produces the same result), retries can cause chaos. Imagine double-charging a customer because the function failed after payment but before confirming success. Furthermore, not all errors are retryable. A temporary network glitch? Retry. Invalid input data or a critical bug in the code? Retrying just wastes resources and delays fixing the real problem, potentially blocking your queue with \"poison pill\" messages.</p>\n<p><strong>Building Resilience:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Design for Idempotency:</strong> This is critical for any function with side effects triggered by asynchronous events. Common techniques include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Using unique transaction IDs passed in the event payload. Before processing, check a DynamoDB table (using conditional writes) to see if that ID has already been successfully processed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Designing database updates to be inherently safe for re-execution (e.g., <code>SET status = 'processed' WHERE status = 'pending'</code>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Utilize Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs):</strong> Configure DLQs (usually an SQS queue or SNS topic) for your asynchronous Lambda event sources (SQS, SNS, EventBridge, etc.). When a message fails processing after the configured number of retries, AWS automatically sends it to the DLQ. This prevents failed messages from blocking the main queue and allows you to inspect, potentially fix, and manually re-drive these failed events later. Monitor your DLQ depths! A growing DLQ is a critical alert.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Smart Error Handling within the Function:</strong> Use <code>try...catch</code> blocks effectively. Differentiate between transient errors (e.g., downstream service throttling, temporary network issues) that might resolve on retry (so re-throw the error or allow Lambda's retry mechanism to handle it) and permanent errors (e.g., validation failed, unrecoverable state). For permanent errors, catch them, log detailed context, potentially emit a custom metric, and return successfully (or specifically signal not to retry) to prevent pointless retries and ensure the message goes to the DLQ if configured.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-lesson-5-infrastructure-as-code-iac-prevents-production-chaos\">Lesson 5: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Prevents Production Chaos</h2>\n<p><strong>The Temptation:</strong> \"It's just a few functions; we'll manage them through the AWS Console for now.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Production Reality:</strong> A typical serverless application isn't just \"a few functions.\" It's a constellation of Lambda functions, API Gateway resources (routes, methods, authorizers), fine-grained IAM roles and policies, DynamoDB tables, SQS queues, SNS topics, EventBridge rules, etc. Trying to manage this complex web manually across multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) via clicks is a recipe for disaster. It's slow, error-prone, impossible to version control, and makes replicating environments reliably a nightmare. We quickly realized manual management was unsustainable.</p>\n<p><strong>The IaC Imperative:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Pick Your Framework and Stick To It:</strong> Mandate the use of an IaC tool from day one for anything beyond trivial experimentation. AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) and AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) are excellent, AWS-native options specifically tailored for serverless. Terraform and the Serverless Framework are also powerful, popular choices.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Automate Everything with CI/CD:</strong> Integrate your IaC framework into a robust CI/CD pipeline (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI). Every commit should trigger automated builds, tests (unit, integration), and deployments. This ensures consistency, repeatability, and reduces the risk of manual deployment errors.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Achieve True Environment Parity:</strong> IaC makes spinning up identical copies of your entire stack for different environments straightforward. This drastically reduces the \"but it worked in dev!\" class of problems.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Adopting serverless on AWS for production applications has been transformative for our team, enabling faster development cycles and incredible scalability. However, it's not a magic bullet. Success requires moving beyond the initial hype and embracing practices tailored to distributed, event-driven architectures. Prioritizing observability, diligently managing costs, mitigating cold starts strategically, engineering for idempotency and robust error handling, and enforcing disciplined automation through Infrastructure as Code are not optional extras – they are the essential lessons learned from running serverless in the real world. The learning curve is undeniable, but mastering these principles unlocks the true power and potential of the serverless paradigm on AWS.</p>\n","subtitle":"Introduction\nHave you heard about serverless on AWS?

The captain outlined a new security protocol and asked Kira to oversee its implementation. Odo adjusted his uniform and nodded as he scanned incoming reports. Kira offered suggestions for patrol routes while Odo confirmed gate readings. By the end of the briefing, all three had agreed on the plan to increase boarding inspections and monitor cargo manifests more closely.\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>prompt2.txt</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-plaintext\">Later that morning, Kira Nerys joined Science Officer Jadzia Dax in the lab for an experimental sensor test. Dr Julian Bashir arrived with new calibration data from Starfleet Medical. As Jadzia calibrated the particle analyzer, Kira reviewed station logs for unusual energy signatures.

They excel at tasks in fraud detection, recommendation engines, social networks, and RAG. Building a knowledge graph is as easy as running a few Cypher queries, but generating those queries from data can be challenging. This guide has shown one way you can generate these queries locally using a text-to-cypher query from Hugging Face.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Jason Koo from Neo4j for this excellent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pdxSlxfqNY\">video tutorial</a> on using a Hugging Face model in Ollama.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-whats-next\">What’s Next?</h3>\n<p>From here you could connect the Neo4j database to an AI assistant or agent to perform RAG, or use the graph to discover relationships and communities of nodes that emerge as the bulk data is processed.</p>\n","subtitle":"Knowledge graphs, also known as semantic networks, are a specialized application of graph databases used to store information about entities (person, location, organization, etc) and their relationships.

Both Numpy and Pandas store everything in memory from start to finish, and every transformation adds to memory use.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>While exploring possible solutions, I wondered about using <code>PySpark</code> because of its ability to handle distributed workloads. But then, I stumbled upon two significant issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>It doesn't have first-class support for running NumPy functions across a cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The environment is costly and bulky since Spark is cluster-based.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Switching to Spark would have required a lot more work. That's where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/\">Polars</a> comes in to save the day. Here are the key reasons why I chose it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Like PySpark’s <code>lazy evaluation</code>, Polars also supports it with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/lazyframe/index.html\"><code>LazyFrame</code></a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>First-class for Numpy functions, even in LazyFrame.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Runs on a single machine and generally offers excellent performance since its based on Rust &amp; internal use of parallel processing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div data-node-type=\"callout\">\n<div data-node-type=\"callout-emoji\">💡</div>\n<div data-node-type=\"callout-text\">If you're not using <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://docs.pola.rs/\">Polars</a> in your work yet, let me tell you, you're missing out on the ultimate Swiss army knife of the Data Engineering world! It's incredibly feature-rich, lightning-fast, supports tons of I/O operations, and boasts an amazingly intuitive API!</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"heading-redesigned-pipeline-components\">Redesigned Pipeline components</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Replace all <code>Pandas Dataframe</code> code with <code>Polars LazyFrame</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Since Polars fully supports Numpy functions, keep using specific Numpy functions that Polars doesn't have built-in.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Switch to <code>Batch Processing</code> for transformations. Ensure each batch creates a <code>LazyFrame</code>, so nothing is stored in memory until the final execution.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Keep adding transformation steps to the LazyFrame and execute them at the end. This approach lets Polars excel by making the most of its <code>Lazy API</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-plaintext\">With the lazy API, Polars doesn't run each query line-by-line but instead processes the full\nquery end-to-end. To get the most out of Polars it is important that you use the lazy API because:\n - The lazy API allows Polars to apply automatic query optimization with the query optimizer.\n - The lazy API allows you to work with larger than memory datasets using streaming.\n - The lazy API can catch schema errors before processing the data.\n</code></pre>\n<h1 id=\"heading-the-actions\">The Actions</h1>\n<p>Enough theory talking, now lets dive into real coding based actions that solved the all the above issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-numpy-function-polars-lazyframe\">Numpy function + Polars Lazyframe</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-python\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> polars <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">as</span> pl\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> numpy <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">as</span> np\n\nrng = np.random.default_rng()\n\nDAYS = <span class=\"hljs-number\">365</span>\nYEARS = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>_00\nPATH = <span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span>_000\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">unit_batch</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">fixed_years=<span class=\"hljs-number\">10</span></span>):</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> (\n            pl.LazyFrame()\n            .with_columns(\n                <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Here I am directly using NumPy's normal() &amp; cumsum() in Polars Lazyframe since</span>\n                <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># it have first class support</span>\n                nor_dis_random=np.cumsum(\n                    rg.normal(<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>, np.sqrt(<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span> / days), (days * fixed_years, paths)).astype(np.float32),\n                    axis=<span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>,\n                    dtype=np.float32,\n                ) <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># I am using Float32 as data structure instead of default Float64</span>\n            ) \n            <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># I need to create lazyframe of shape (x,y) from normal distribution data of shape (x,y)</span>\n            <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Initially `nor_dis_random` is ArrayType column to which I am exploding to create y columns</span>\n            <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># The beauty of Polars Lazy API is we can keep adding steps to Query plan.</span>\n            .with_columns(pl.col(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"nor_dis_random\"</span>).arr.to_struct().alias(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"array_struct\"</span>))\n            .unnest(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"array_struct\"</span>)\n            .drop(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"nor_dis_random\"</span>)\n        )\n\n <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Creating stack of all batches of lazyframe, that will eventually get concated</span>\nnormal_dist_random_cum_sum_frames = [\n    _unit_chunk(i)\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span> i <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">in</span> alive_it(\n        chunks, title=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Normal Distribution Cumulative sum\"</span>, force_tty=<span class=\"hljs-literal\">True</span>, total=len(chunks)\n    )\n]\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\"># This steps is very important as here I am vertically stacking all batches but still as LazyFrame</span>\nnormal_dist = pl.concat(normal_dist_random_cum_sum_frames, how=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"vertical\"</span>)\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"heading-batch-processing-on-polars-lazyframe\">Batch Processing on Polars Lazyframe</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-python\">BATCH_SIZE = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>_000\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">calculate_no_of_batches</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">row_count: int, batch_size: int = <span class=\"hljs-number\">10</span></span>) -&gt; int:</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> row_count // batch_size + (row_count % batch_size &gt; <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>)\n\n\nein_corr_a, ein_corr_b = [], []\n\nno_of_batches = calculate_no_of_batches(\n    normal_dist1.select(pl.len()).collect().item(), batch_size=BATCH_SIZE\n)\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Batch processing loop</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span> batch <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">in</span> alive_it(range(no_of_batches), title=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Einstein summation\"</span>, force_tty=<span class=\"hljs-literal\">True</span>):\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Polars Lazy API provides as with slice() to iterate over lazyframe without actually </span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># loading data in memory.
